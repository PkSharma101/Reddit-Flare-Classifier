I heard that they were cheap if I source from this country and I've seen some very promising suppliers and manufacturers from India's B2B marketplaces with good prices. To cut the story short, I've got over 50 suppliers blowing my phone and email but my problem is 90% of them do not offer safe payment methods such as PayPal Goods and Services or Escrow (kind of like Alibaba's Trade Assurance).

All of them also seem to have the same method, send photos of the masks (some are really just recycled photos taken from elsewhere) and they do not even offer sample/trial orders (orders with very less quantity to check the item and verify authenticity). Some do, but minimum order is like 500-1000pcs which is definitely not a trial order. Somehow, I got a feeling that all these guys are part of one big elaborate scam. Asking to wire money through T/T, WU, MG etc. and PayPal Family & Friends. Some have websites but they are really very sketchy and badly designed.

We cannot buy from China either as their masks cost more than $5 dollars a piece even with a MOQ of 1000pcs. But we all know that 3M masks do not even reach a retail price of $2. Another reason why we can't buy from China is because the moment you sell more than the SRP, our government will arrest you and your goods get confiscated and donated. A close friend of mine owns a bunch of retail stores hence, why we are looking for extremely cheap 3M masks. Plus, we have contacts with a lot of private buyers and companies who want to buy masks at very high quantities.

So to sum it all up, there are no n95 masks here because no one wants to sell because the government won't allow us to sell it over the SRP (anti price-gouging), and we can't just rely on donations either.

So a question to all you legit suppliers and manufacturers out there, am I just asking to get screwed? What are your suggestions? How do you handle transactions from foreign buyers?"

I am cancelling my connections and I hope what I say in this post are compelling enough for you to support me.I am copying and pasting from a [comment I made in another thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/adu4hg/indias_massive_jio_carrier_is_blocking_vpn_sites/edkyke4/), after someone suggested that I should make a thread about this.

Jio is using

1. Deep packet inspection
2. Carrier-grade NAT
3. Poorly configured stateful IPv6
4. Almost completely locked down router with some non-sequitor options
5. Clueless customer service, who just say ""we can't talk about X or Y or Z"" and who often do not even understand the question. If you ask about IPv6 settings, they'll say they can't help you, and then proceed to misinterpret it as a request for a static IP address. 

The first two are reasons enough to not use this shitty ISP.

To explain in more detail:

1. Every bit of data transmitted on the internet is transmitted as a packet. Think of this packet as a [matryoshka doll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll). What Jio does is open these dolls to see what the innermost dolls look like. That obliterates your privacy. Jio is using software that is good enough to deny you service even if you use strong encryption. I believe that heuristic analysis and the use of known signatures is a part of the firewall.
2. Before the days of IPv4 pool saturation, you would get a public IPv4 address (or even more than one) from your ISP, while your LAN would have a private IP address from a range reserved by the IETF (such as 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x). When these addresses became more scarce, ISPs moved to dynamic allocation, so unused addresses in their range would be recycled for other customers to use based on uptime. However, each customer still received a unique public IP address. Eventually, people decided that the principles used on large enterprise LANs could be applied to ISPs as well. On a service with CG-NAT, your public IP address is now shared with many other customers.
 * This is bad for several reasons, and performance and reliability are two of them. For instance, you could have trouble transmitting UDP packets across two routing tables. On a poorly configured network though, security is an even bigger concern, because you can expose multiple customer subnets to each other. The firewall on their router is a major cause for concern. The default is to allow all connections, rather than only established or related connections, while blocking others.
3. IPv6 was introduced with the aim of mitigating the shortage of network addresses, and to also reduce the workload on network infrastructure, by changing the way addresses are assigned. I will not get into too much detail as I am no expert on IPv6 networking and haven't really messed around with it until I got Jio, but I can assure you that they are not following the guidelines or best practices for deploying IPv6.
 * For instance, WAN is assigned in a stateful manner, with only a /128 address being given to your router. Your LAN is by default configured to be stateless, with a /64 prefix length. However your LAN prefix is not assigned by the ISP, but is instead assigned from a reserved linked-local IPv6 range defined in an outdated RFC. So you literally get none of the benefits of IPv6, and all of the downsides of IPv4, as a NAT is involved in your connection.
4. Bridging mode is completely broken. You still need to configure your WAN interface even when you want to bridge the Jio router to your own equipment.
5. Jio's customer service is brain-dead retarded, and will simply refuse to help if you want anything more than basic troubleshooting. They also don't have any L2 or higher technicians available on the phone. Also, the best part is that their TSP and ISP divisions are separate, yet they seem to use the same customer care number! God help you if you call from your registered mobile number, because then you will be quickly connected to a human from one department, who will promptly refuse to look at issues involving the other department, and you will completely fail to connect to that particular department. They won't even transfer your call! Also when you use a non-registered number to get around this and provide them your registered mobile number, they have no means of identifying which service tickets belong to which department.
 * When I raised a complaint with the fiber department, and then called the jiofi department to register a separate complaint, the jiofi team would insist that the ticket was raised for jiofi, and when I raised a ticket with the jiofi team, the fiber team would insist that the ticket was raised for fiber!

I will admit that I am still using the JioFi connection, but that is because I paid for a year of service, and that only gets used for things like netflix and amazon prime when I am on the move. It's not ideal, but I'm kinda stuck with that one."

As an Indian international student; after observing the Western European education system, I am shocked to see how radically different it is than our own system. I personally think that it is due to the fact that us Indians are conditioned since we are toddlers to put our unrelenting faith in our ""elders"". The only problem is that many of our so called  ""elders"" are also normal human beings with their own problems and flaws. 

When I first went abroad, I remember how some of our jealous relatives were taunting my parents about how I will lose all my ""culture"", ""riti-riwaz"" after stepping out the country even though I was only going for a couple of months. I literally had to touch the feet of 10 thousand different people to get a proper dose of ashirwad before finally boarding the plane and literally had a back pain throughout the entire flight. Our parents have panick attacks if you don't say a proper namaste to a random ""aunty"" who you don't give a flying fuck about; you are taught fake history both at home and school where you are force-fed the idea of andh deshbhakti; you get told that countries such as US and UK are only successful because of the Indians scientists and doctors working there, and that you should feel lucky to be born in such a beautiful pure society. I also had narcissist relatives telling me that instead of feeling disenfranchised, I should be happy that at least I was born in a upper cast family. 

  
My point is simple. I really do not mind culture, traditions, riti or riwaz. I think they all have their own place and can add a certain level of beauty to a culture; however, I do believe that they should never supersede real world problems, facts and logic that this country is so deprived of.  

This is also where it gets really dark. If you are someone who has ability to think critically or you're someone with a certain level of common sense, living in India can be so overbearing because there is so much focus on symbolism. You don't touch the feet of your relatives? You scoundrel! You come late to a pooja? That's sacrilege! You hang out with non vegetarian friends? Chiee!!  You believe India can be more secular? deshdhrohi! 

I honestly do not blame Whatsapp or any big media company for the wave of anti-intellectualism in India. It is easy to make fun of these corporations by using words such as ""Whatsapp university"" and ""Facebook pathshala"" but the underlying disgusting mentality that is so pervasive in our society is the root cause of why we are not progressing on a global scale. Whatsapp university is not making us dumb, it is just spreading our omnipresent dumbness in a more effective manner. 

Many of our parents or relatives get triggered if you don't put a tika on your forehead after a religious ceremony but they spit out pan openly in the streets with complete impunity and disregard for local laws. Another real life example is of a person I know who got into an accident due to open potholes in the monsoon season. Instead of blaming the municipality for this, he believed that it happened to him because he did not brake a coconut after purchasing his vehicle. 

In schools you they force you to sing absolute bull shit slogans like ""bacche man ke sacche"" when this country has  one of the highest rates of rapes of underage girls, and in many schools in India if you dare to question your teacher, you get harassed and abused mentally, emotionally and physically. 

You go to a wedding in some parts of the country and it is a common sight to see hungry kids gathering around the tent to look for thrown leftovers by people, while on the other hands the women worry about the colors of their sarees. I do not even understand how these people can digest that food while looking at the eyes of those hungry kids. The more you travel around the world, the more you realize how devoided people of India are of any empathy or compassion towards their fellow citizens! 

How can this country move forward when it focuses so much on frivolous symbolism and have that level of cultural baggage on its back. And yes! I know! There are other countries that have the same problem; however, I was born in India and it disturbs me that our country does not have its priorities straight, and probably never will!

The absolute worst part about all of this is that if you dissent or do not agree with the way the our society works then they point the finger at you and make you feel like as if you are the wrong one! If you refuse to partake in the mass shared delusion and psychosis of the ""cultured"" Indian society, there is something wrong with you as a person!   


I try my best everyday to remain optimistic about our country but whenever I open up the news, whatsapp, twitter; or even listen to my own relatives and friends, I feel utterly nihilistic. I hope things take turns for the better in India but I won't bet my money on it so because when you combine religion, symbolism, politics, and fake superiority complex, then you have an absolute mess and chaos on your hands.

Sorry for my prolonged rant but I do believe that if Indian society was a person, it would be diagnosed with a severe case of Narcissistic personality disorder."

I turn on Indian news channels and everyone says ""we always wanted peace, Pakistan doesn't want peace"". 
The media is clearly not truthful on either sides and have been manipulating citizens of both countries for years. 
I just came here to tell you guys that not all Pakistanis hate India and I know not all Indians hate Pakistan. However, we can all agree that both countries have different political differences but we don't hate the people. 
I currently live in the US and I have a lot of Indian friends. We are like family now. It's come to the point that we usually forget that we are from two different countries who hate each other. To us we are all the same. We are all from different religious backgrounds as well but it doesn't matter to us, there is no hatred whatsoever.
We all watch cricket together and recently when India and Pakistan were versing each other we were all having a great time.
Politics and media has ruined us.
Peace and love,
From a Pakistani

Say that I’m mentally ill and unable to attend my classes regularly. The authorities are aware of it since the beginning and they’ve seen me at my worst. I had to skip my previous semester as I had to get admitted at a psychiatric ward and now I’m stacked up with arrears and penalties to pay. I’m under lot of stress and peer pressure. So I’ve decided to discontinue in order to take care of my mental health but the officials tell me that it’s not possible to drop-out unless I pay the rest of my tuition fee which is definitely not affordable by me anytime soon. What options do I have since my entire mental health depends on this one decision?

The college is VIT, Chennai."

Bihar government issued made it mandatory to have new pass issued from DM for new lockdown. The order was withdrawn as shown in the circular below as well as news clippings. My father had old pass from 1st part of lockdown since new one wasn't issued due to holiday yesterday and order being withdrawn by the government. Since government is so local police claimed traveling without Lockdown #2 pass is not allowed, hence the pass. 

My father works in bank and travels with his bike to work. Despite no problem other than minor stop and check during first phase of lockdown, he was stopped today and asked for pass and documents but even then Police fined him.

He was given 2 options  seizure of hi bike or pay challan. He paid the challan of course but fact remains he had necessary travel pass, a copy of government circular allowing his movement, his bank document.

If this is how so called ""essential workers"" are harassed, how will they do their work. But I shouldn't be surprised though given even doctors have been beaten, evicted and worse.

edit: to the people claiming it is for helmet, my aplogies my father hadn't memorised every single line of Motor act, I'll ask him to do that today so he can force police to right exact code on the challan because as we all know Indian Police and that too Bihar Police are the most honest people in the world. They wouldn't dare lie ever./s


Also my father is a 53 year old man who needs to drives 60 kms to work evryday so yes he was wearing helmet and gloves and shoes. He also has N95 mask for use at bank as well as sanitizer because he's dealing with 500+ people on daily basis."

I know everyone is unsure of the future at this point but I thought that I could get some advice and opinions on this topic. I have a flight booked with United Airlines to leave the USA on August 31st, arriving in Delhi, and was planning to backpack through Ladakh, Himachal, and Uttarkhand. United Airline's policy now is saying that you must choose to change your flight by April 30th, the latest, in order to have change fees waived, and they will issue a travel voucher. Change fees are about $350. If I go ahead and cancel the flight to receive a the travel voucher (no refunds) and things seem safe to travel again in September, re-booking the same flight will cost $300 extra, as the cost of the flight has increased. 

My other option is to rebook for January and head to South India instead, although it would be disappointing since I had my Himalayas trip planned far in advance and I am very excited. Being in isolation with just me and my dog for the past month, thinking about my upcoming trip to India has kept me going. September and January are the only months in the year that I can travel because of work.

Thank you for taking the time to read this!"

Only 13 out of 1000 marriages result in a divorce in India. 
It could be due to arranged marriages, society pressure and the stigma attached to it. Most importantly it is because of the financial dependence.

There are a lot of cultural and religious traditions in my family that are borrowed both from our ancestral Lucknow and from adopted Karachi. I remember celebrating the night with a mix of Hindu, Muslim and Christian friends.

I posted this last week on my Facebook, and wanted to share here with our friends from the other side. Perhaps we can see some commonality. I hope this gets posted. (reposting again

\--

The night of #15Shabaan has never been an ordinary night for a Muslim teenager. For some of us in Karachi, it is almost like Eid - new clothes, cakes and presents. For others, it is about food and sweetmeats. For almost everyone, it is about prayers and astaghfaar. For me, however, it was about firecrackers and patakhay for many many years.

Growing up in Karachi, Shab e Barat was one of those few traditions that continued to connect us with the longing of AJTFS throughout the year despite it just being a one-day event. It is celebrated every year on the night of 15th of Shabaan (neema Shabaan = Middle of Shabaan) with much fanfare, prayer, and nazars. For me, what started with firecrackers and food during my teenage years turned into a deeply spiritual practice over the years. It is customary among many Muslims to pen a letter of love and dedication to Imam-e-Zamana (a.s.) during the night of the 15th. This letter is called ""Areeza"" meaning ""Request"".

As kids, we loved writing and submitting an Areeza. I can't be sure about how Areezas are submitted elsewhere. In my family, in Karachi, we'd get a few blank Areezas from the mosque and then complete them using a qalam - a type of pen made from a cut, dried reed, used for Islamic calligraphy. The qalam would be dipped in an ink made from saffron and itr (non alcoholic scent), and then we'd write our requests, dreams, aspirations, and profess our love for the Imam e Waqt. It would be an intensely personal moment and an opportunity to share our inner most desires and fears. Once completed, these could be delivered to any tributary - a river, lake or the sea. I always felt the longing and the belief took precedence over the process and the tools, so I’ve tried to write Areeza’s throughout the year instead of just Shabaan.

10-15 years ago growing up in Nazimabad, we had only a few options. We could either go to our local mosque Noor Ul Emaan where they'd have paper Areezas for us to submit. And then the mosque volunteers would deliver these completed Areezas to Naity Jaity (Native's Jetty). The second option was to write an Areeza at home and then go to Naity Jaity ourselves. Now this second option was much fascinating for the youth as it likely involved a road trip!

I have to admit, during my teenage years, my fascination for the day and what followed was more superfluous than spiritual. I remember the day starting with fasting and helping my mother with groceries. There would be an elaborate nazar later in the day so we all looked forward to the kabab, halva and the puriz. We'd make portions of the nazar and take to the graveyard. After offering Fateha for the grandparents and other relatives, we'd distribute the nazar amongst the custodians. Back at home, we would break our fasts, and perform amaal for the day. The lucky ones got to sneak out and celebrate with firecrackers and patakhay.

In our particular home, we had a mix of Lucknow and Karachi traditions. After the evening Nazar, we’d start our amaal and stay up for the whole night. After midnight, we complete the amaal and start writing our Areezas. My mother would make dough balls for us to bury our Areezas in. I remember she telling me the reason why we use dough balls was because the fish from the Naity Jaity would carry the Areezas off to AJTFS. The place used to be packed - people from all walks of life, vendors and small groups from all over. Everyone converging on this auspicious night to share their deepest desires, aspirations and fears with the Imam e Waqt (a.s). It would be a surreal moment to reckon with. In my family, we were always to spend the night in Ibadaat rather than being swept in the culture of firecrackers that seemed to have taken root. I remember stopping on our way back at Saabri Nihari Saddar and having Nihari early morning just as crimson would start to engulf the horizon.

There is much debate today about the necessity of faith and religion. No matter which lens you view Shab e Baraat through, it is a testament that one’s belief is at the core of our individual survival. All of us, many of us, while we may speak different languages, follow different religions, we are almost always, expressing the same faith in a power beyond us.

And whether we believe in this or not, we acknowledge deep down, that there are things beyond your control.

And that is what binds us all together. #EidMubarak"

India is one of the few countries that have a low percentage of confirmed coronavirus cases. This is due to the Indian government's willingness to care for its citizens and for the citizens of other countries.

Recently, many Western and some Eastern governments have found China's emergency aid to be faulty; however, **there are no reported cases of faulty emergency aid from India**; in fact, India supplies over 30 countries, even the United States, with hydroxychloroquine, a drug that is currently being tested as a treatment for coronavirus. I applaud the Indian government and the Indian people for doing their part in fighting the coronavirus.

Because India has a large skilled labor force, I believe that, if enough of us convince government officials in India and other countries, to invest in 'Made in India' emergency aid, we can assure high-quality emergency aid for recipient countries and provide more jobs in the growing Indian workforce.

In addition, if enough countries are willing to invest in 'Made in India' emergency aid, they are probably going to offer additional money towards other parts of the Indian government's expenses, such as India's defense budget.

I recommend contacting your representative/senator/Minister of Parliament/etc. ASAP.

I wish you all the best of luck during such a challenging period of our lives.

*This is not a shitpost on the Chinese government or on Chinese people, because I know that there are good and bad people in all countries; however, we must hold all countries accountable for their actions, and China's faulty emergency aid is no exception. In my opinion, the Chinese and United States governments haven't done enough to stop the spread of the coronavirus, but India is a good example of a country that puts its people first.*"

I've heard cats do better alone, so I'm open to getting a cat, but I'm concerned how much the per month cost will be. As I'm thinking of adopting, there won't be major  initial cost.

If cats are too expensive, I'm thinking of going with a guinea pig or a hamster but idk how fun having one of those will be. 

Do you have any suggestions for my situation? Thanks!

* Does the CAB Bill affect Indians(Hindus, Muslims, anyone)? Ans. No. It has nothing to do with Indians in any way

* Whom does it apply to? Ans. Only to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians from 3 countries, who are facing religious persecution in those countries AND who are already in India before 1st Dec 2014.

* Which 3 countries? Ans. Pakistan, Bangladesh & Afghanistan

* In what way does it benefit Hindus, Sikhs, Jains,Buddhists, parsis & Christians from these 3 countries? Ans. Their residency requirement has been reduced from 11 to 5 years. And they can claim citizenship as a right under this law

* Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro’ the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro’ naturalization rules….11 years of residence etc.

* Will illegal muslims immigrants from these 3 countries be automatically deported under this bill? Ans. No. The usual process applies. Their application for naturalisation as citizens will be as per the governing law and based on demerits of the case

* Can Hindus facing persecution in other countries apply under this law? Ans. No

* Does this bill apply to other forms of persecution – Political, racial, sexual etc? Ans. No. The bill is very specific in its intent – religious persecution of above notified minorities in these 3 countries

* Why only these 3 countries ? And why only religious persecution of above Notified denominations? Ans. These 3 countries have a track record of pervasive, systematic & institutionalized persecution of minority Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians especially the perennial persecution in Pakistan

* What about Sri Lankan tamils? Ans. (1) The war has been over for the a decade now. (2) There never was any persecution on religious lines. It was on racial faultlines. And over the decades of civil war, the Sri Lankans have put an end to institutionalized discrimination of Tamils

* Doesn’t India have an obligation under the UN to take care of refugees? Ans. Yes it does. And it is not shying away from it. But it has no obligation to offer citizenship. Each country has its own rules for naturalization. India is not going to turn away other refugees under this law. It will play host to them under UN rules, in the implicit expectation that some day they will return to their homelands when the conditions improve. But in the case of Minorities from these 3 countries, this law acknowledges the reality that the environment of persecution in these 3 countries is never going to improve

Now, let's address them. 

>Does the CAB Bill affect Indians(Hindus, Muslims, anyone)? Ans. No. It has nothing to do with Indians in any way.

That's blatantly false. The CAB automatically gives citizenship to non-Muslims even if they are illegals. The BJP will then impose a nationwide-NRC. Indian Muslims will now require extraordinary proof to prove their Indian citizenship. 

NRC will follow after CAB. Amit Shah said this himself: https://twitter.com/DilliDurAst/status/1205047059654402048

**[Here’s Amit Shah saying non-Muslims won’t even need to submit documents for NRC since they’ll be given citizenship anyway.](https://twitter.com/DilliDurAst/status/1207191726785323008)**

>Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro’ the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro’ naturalization rules….11 years of residence etc.

India is not a party to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees or the 1967 Protocol, nor does it have a legal framework and national refugee status determination system. 

So there is no way for a Muslim refugee from those 3 countries to come to India. They can never get Indian citizenship. 

>Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro’ the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro’ naturalization rules….11 years of residence etc.

No, they don't have to go through the ""usual process of acquiring citizenship"". They are under-trial for the crime of entering India illegally or overstaying their visas. The Indian law that governs illegal immigrants is The Foreigners Act, 1946. Under this law, illegal immigrants have to deported back to their country. They don't get citizenship. 

>Why only these 3 countries ? And why only religious persecution of above Notified denominations? Ans. These 3 countries have a track record of pervasive, systematic & institutionalized persecution of minority Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians especially the perennial persecution in Pakistan.

Among our neighbouring countries, Sri Lanka has a track record of persecuting Tamils, Burma of persecuting Muslims, and China of persecuting Tibetans and Muslims. So no, those three countries are not special. 

>What about Sri Lankan tamils? Ans. (1) The war has been over for the a decade now. (2) There never was any persecution on religious lines. It was on racial faultlines. And over the decades of civil war, the Sri Lankans have put an end to institutionalized discrimination of Tamils.

That's not the point. The point is that we already have Sri Lankan refugees and they have been specifically excluded from this act. 

[ Sri Lankan Tamil refugees— those who fled ethnic violence and those who were born here— fear deportation in the aftermath of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act that excludes them.](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/citizenship-act-aftermath-sri-lankan-tamil-refugees-live-fear-deportation-114097)

>Doesn’t India have an obligation under the UN to take care of refugees? Ans. Yes it does. And it is not shying away from it. But it has no obligation to offer citizenship. Each country has its own rules for naturalization. India is not going to turn away other refugees under this law. It will play host to them under UN rules, in the implicit expectation that some day they will return to their homelands when the conditions improve.

All completely false. As answered above, India is not a party to UN convention on refugees so India is actually not playing by UN rules. We are legally not required to (before CAB) host any refugees. 

>But in the case of Minorities from these 3 countries, this law acknowledges the reality that the environment of persecution in these 3 countries is never going to improve

Apart from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh are countries with which India enjoys good diplomatic relations. A better (and more diplomatic) approach would have been to work with them and improve the lot of minorities in those countries. [Bangladesh is already unhappy at us because we clubbed them with Afghanistan and Pakistan](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/bangladesh-india-citizenship-amendment-bill-pak-afghanistan-modi-hasina-1628304-2019-12-14)


>Why shouldn’t Baluchis, Ahmediyas in Pakistan, Rohingayas in Myanmar not be considered for this kindness? Ans. They will be considered under the existing laws. Not under the special category

Again false, there are basically no existing laws under which they can claim asylum in India. We are deporting them.

In short, the act is discriminatory in nature as it clearly states that India is only interested in taking non-Muslim refugees from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Coupled with NRC, CAA will create a hostile environment for Indian Muslims where they will be at the complete mercy of the government."

There was no sign about exact toll to be paid, everyone paid a fixed price, some paid none. That made me suspect of scheme. 

So I made an RTI application, asking cost of bridge, copy of toll collection GO, vendor collecting the toll currently, how much toll period is left etc. The Bridge dept made my application to travel from dept to dept for a year and half. Ultimately gave me almost everything (I need to send application to another dept for part of application) In mean time, I used to ask my relatives about status of bridge toll JLT. and I got to know that one fine day (within 2 weeks, after receiving RTI reply) with lot of fanfare local politician said that he is doing a seva to public by removing the toll on on all such bridges, 13 in total.

Fun Fact: 

* 1. I filed RTI only for one bridge and this corruption was found that bridge dept, local mafia, police and politicians were milking 3-4 lakhs everyday. 5000 vehicles on each bridgex Rs 5 per vehicle x 13 bridges = 3.25 lakh. 
* 2. Cost of bridge (23 lakh) was not recovered even after 25 years. Irony is local politician trying to be saint/hero by not involving in corruption.
* 3. I happen to meet someone who bragged about his uncle being the toll collector for toll station I had filed RTI, while this whole thing was going on.

I could do all these as I was using office address, whose entry was heavily regulated under STPI laws. **It is 10 years now, but I have been told to never talk about this to anyone, else I may get killed.** Crazy."

I had posted a just few days ago on how investing heavily in only a handful of ""profitable talents"" viz. dance, singing, comedy and cricket; and media's blatant neglect of other talents might discourage talented individuals from pursuing their interests in other fields of sports and art. 

And today I read about these champions of indomitable determination. They proved how, despite their hardships, special abilities and limited support, one can make history. One must also applaud their parents and well wishers for truly believing in their children when the world generally looks down upon people with special needs & abilities.

Most of these sports persons will soon return to their normal lives full of obstacles. I only hope that these men & women of passion get as much support and nurturing as possible from the govt as well as the society. They made India proud. They deserve to be rewarded and rewarded well for bringing glory to the nation. And more importantly for bringing a ray of hope in the lives of millions of others.

Ambulance shows up in 4 min, police show up in 20.As described above. Last night on the way from the airport to my place, we saw a body lying in the middle of a three lane road with vehicles overtaking from the either side of him.

I then maneuvered my car to block the middle lane, by stopping the car on the lane, with indicators on.

The accident must have happened not more than 5 min before we reached that spot.

So I called the police. And an ambulance. I called the ambulance first, gave the operator a location, but he didn't know where that was, so the operator asked if I will talk with the ambulance driver and I agreed. I then called police.

As titled, the ambulance was really fast, reached the accident location within 5 min. The police took much longer to show up at about twenty minutes. We spoke with the police for about 5 min and went on our way.

In the end, even though we looked like the perpetrator (when we stopped in front of the victim to block traffic), the police didn't give us any problems.

The purpose of this post was to highlight how the bystander effect is so true. Nobody thought of calling and ambulance or police. Nobody waited to help the victim. Also surprised that an ambulance can show up so quickly.

The virus is spread from the water droplets that come out of an infected person when they speak or cough or sneeze. So maintaining enough distance (at least 2m) from people (anyone) is important. Virus stays in air for sometime depending upon the humidity, so wearing mask is important. Virus can show its first symptoms after 5-12 days so don’t neglect social distancing ( this term hardly anyone knows in better way but it is just keeping distance from people of at least about 2m or more) at any cost. Virus can stay on different surface so maintaining personal and surrounding hygiene is important. But no govt official or media is taking an effort to educate people about all this information. Rather forcing everyone to stay at home. I understand that this will ultimately keep people away from other but what if the lockdown ends? People will still crash into others personal space and the whole thing will start all over again. 

So did we failed to educate people?"

So I heard about Asur from Reddit where op praises the show, so checked IMDb, it had a rating of 8.7 so I decided to give it a shot.
Watched it within 2 days and was completely disappointed .
The show is full of plot holes some of these are,
* The police couldn't find a coffin in freshly dug grave within a limited area.
No one noticed the reverse clock until our protagonist points it out.(ep 3)
* Hacking the nic using codes from geekforgeeks.
*Oxygen chamber having timer instead of an oximeter. Also the clock speed up when hostages are idle but works Normal when they're trying to kill eachother where oxygen consumption is increased.

You can guess what is going to happen next it just blatantly shows who are bad guys, no misdirection, nothing.

The show just copies elements from shows like mentalist, mindhunter ,Sherlock , Dexter and mix with Indian mythology and some scientific words.

The show fools the viewers into thinking it is smart which the show clearly isn't.

Only thing which is good is the soundtrack.
A complete disappointment.

My rating 6.5/10."

Now the Challenge:--> Discuss any religious topic with your family member. Ask a lot of why? and Share your outcomes. 

\----------------------------------

Full Story

\----------------------------------

A thought occurred in my mind.

We know Rama as a ""Maryada Purushottam"" and ""Ideal Person"". So What did he do So that we can call him a ideal Person.I searched my mind and only able to figure out some like left kingdom, left his wife as a king etc.

I couldn't find any other thing.

So I went and have a discussion with my Mother. I told her ""what did Rama do? And Why should I follow him? There are a lot of people like Gandhiji, Bhagat Singh etc and these people did this kind of work.That's why someone should follow these people. So What about Rama?""

My mother told me ""Rama Left the kingdom, left his wife as a king and he is a god who took birth as a human for us. So we should workshop him. And don't ask these type of question about religion and to religious people(i.e priest)?"".

 I quietly asked ""Why should not I asked question about religion and to priests?"" Mother told me ""Because they are always right we should do as they told us to.""

I told her ""if I got infected from Corona and A priest say that God chose me for his work. Now spread that virus and do your duty"" So that will be right?

She thought for a second then said ""No, you should ask question.""

So I told her ""Maa, There are a lot of people who think that whatever their religious leader saying is right. They neither ask question nor actually think about that. They just do whatever their religious man is saying. And These people belongs to every religious Hindu, Muslim, Sikh etc.. And These Tablighi Jamaat are also such people""

As Soon as I put up the Muslim reference(and other fact about them) in our discussion She said ""*So Now you have became anti-national also"".*

I was like WTF. **I live in a remote village. On daily basis my mother watch a little news on these shit channels. You can imagine the kind of damage Godi media have done that ""A Mother is calling his son Anti-National"".**

To Godi Media: I will do what ever in my control to stop you. and If any person from Godi Media is reading this ""Shame On you"".

Ok Done.

**Now come the Challenge Part:**

Discuss any religious topic with your family member, ask a lot of why?  And share your thought."

Traffic was insane, I was tired, and there were a ton of people in the street. When my Uber arrived, I looked around and realized the super nice, noise canceling headphones I bought before I left the U.S. were gone. I probably got distracted and someone picked them up when I wasn't looking. I was angry at myself for being dumb. I've since been pricing new headphones.

Last night, I got done at the gym and went to the supermarket next to the gym to grab some food. After checking out, the cashier pulled me over to the side of the store and took my headphones out from a cubby by the counter. He saw me drop them nearly 2 weeks ago and grabbed them for me. I'm completely shocked, grateful, and appreciative as this would be a highly unlikely scenario in the U.S. Living/working in India has already been an amazing experience and this only makes it better."

As an OBGYN resident doctor, I realised the lack of credible and evidenced based information about pregnancy and contraception to women directly. As doctors we want you guys to have a ton of information but we don't really have a lot of time to run you through all this.

Soooo I developed a completely free (ad free! bias free! random product advertising free! affiliate link free!) app to track vitamins, sonographies, doctors appointments; answer all your FAQs, ideal diet, prenatal yoga exercises, updates on growth of your baby, how to deal with everyday problems in pregnancy and when to ask for help and go to the doctor immediately.

This app also tracks your periods, tracks your birth control pills, gives you medical valid information about different methods of contraception, and answers your FAQs

This app is available in English, Hindi and Marathi because I didn't want ANY indian woman to miss out on knowledge just because she is not comfortable with English.

I'm doing this because as an OBGYN I truly believe that we need to empower ourselves and this is only done when the correct information is given to YOU.

YOU are in charge of your body.

First 4 months she paid back the EMI amount that got debited from my account on time. 

But now she won’t accept my calls and WhatsApp is also one tick so she may have blocked me. She hasn’t paid back two EMI debits and my bank balance has gone in negative. I have to do my shopping on my credit card now. 

I went online on netbanking but I couldn’t find any option for ongoing EMIs. 

Total amount of the laptop was around 1,40,000 and she paid me back around 28,000 and now she owes me around 14,000.

Some people hsd closed a bunch of colony entrance roads with bamboo barricades with help from a friend of mine who runs a decoration business. This happened 2 days ago, without any permission from police, and now if anyone needed to go out to buy essentials, they would be forced to use a gulli (small road) just beside the barricade. 

Note: One of those people had stated two weeks ago on the colony WhatsApp group that he had seen a vegetable vendor licking the vegetables, and when he screamed and tried to catch him, he ran away. (I and many of my friends don't believe him, as he is a far right wnger who wants the complete destruction of muslims, judging from some of his past WhatsApp forwards. Also, there's no way a vendor with a heavy vegetable carrying thela can outrun the man who ""saw him licking"")

The problem with the barricades? The people living around that gully road began having problems with everyone going from that side. Infuriated, they put up a barricade as well. 

One of my friends who lives just beside the barricades, just called me and told that a couple of police vehicles arrived and those people were called. They were scolded heavily and were warned to not do anything like this again. The barricades were then removed. 

I was extremely angry at the fact that they didn't even think of other people who live there, while putting up barricades without permission. It was an unnecessary move that didn't serve any purpose. Someone from the colony had reportedly phoned the police yesterday and I'm glad that they were removed."

Keep doing you, y'all.

He seems to be having a really hard time with the adjustment. I want to teach my son some phrases that he can say to the boy so that he knows he has a friend. I don't know what language he speaks but I know he calls his Dad ""Nana""?  Can someone help us with some simple stuff like ""do you want to play"" or ""friend"" or something?  Also any advice would be helpful.

Edit:. Also, I speak only English and Spanish so I need help with pronunciation. :)

Edit:. I'll keep everybody updated. The little boy wasn't at school on Friday because he doesn't come on Fridays I learned. Monday is a holiday here so they won't be in class together until Tuesday at the earliest. My kid picked up on the phrases really quickly and is excited to get to use them!  Thank you so much everybody for your help. I will absolutely let you know how it goes!  Also, thank you for the gold kind stranger!

Update:. Daycare never found out the right language. :(. Although, it doesn't turn out that it really makes a difference. His little friend is picking up English really quickly and not crying anymore at school.  Thank you all so much for your information. It did help my son try and find ways to connect, which means that he made a little friend anyway. Kids really do learn so fast! I'm very glad that my son was sympathetic to his situation.

That’s not to say that the right is unlimited or something, there sure must be reasonable restrictions wherever applicable, the question must be how much the limits must be, that is, where should we draw the border, if at all, it’s necessary..

And also when someone voices their opinion in a large gathering, for example, especially this subreddit, it’s not practical to know what opinion offends which person. It’s simply not viable. Furthermore, censoring something one says just because it hurts someone else’s beliefs or feelings can be counterintuitive, as they’ll just be more vocal in raising their opinion.

So, if we ignore some Jamat escapees our primary objective must be over as it’s been over a month since we’ve closed off our borders.

Now what’s left is *Community transmission* which, for some insanely bizarre reason, is still being denied by many state governments, also the fact that we don’t have enough testing kits makes me wonder who are being tested? Are people voluntarily getting tested when they show symptoms ? Which is highly unlikely unless they’re seriously ill. Because, even some people I know got cold during lockdown yet didn’t get tested.

I want to bring to your attention a possible scam on youtube, and wanted your advice on how to proceed.

I won a phone giveaway contest on the popular tech channel PhoneRadar, in July. PhoneRadar is a pretty huge tech channel, with 924K followers on YT. I was supposed to get an Oppo R17 pro. I was really excited and messaged him my email ID. He replies to me a month later asking me to provide my address within 24 hours, or else I get disqualified, and I sent him my details.

Several months passed by. I kept emailing him once every few days asking about the status. He finally replied on 1st November saying ""I will get back to you soon."". No reply since.

&#x200B;

Eventually I started posting on his videos begging him to reply, but no response.

Today I tweeted on his handle telling him to stop ignoring giveaway winners, which really pissed him off. He says and I quote:"" We don't ignore anyone. You kept spamming questioning without a reason and hence no update happened. You had won the R17 Pro & once we see that you stop the spam and remove the messages we will initiate the shipment. ""

So he didnt ship the phone because I asked for the status twice or thrice a month? And he calls me a spammer for that!Its a blatant lie, and what's worse? Its going to fly because his followers will blindly support him.

Please advise what I should do next. Is there any way to bring more attention to his lie and tweets?I have provided proofs of my emails here. I have always been patient and polite to him.

email proofs: [https://imgur.com/a/CO2YUV9](https://imgur.com/a/CO2YUV9)him declaring me as the winner on YT:  [https://imgur.com/a/fUA78by](https://imgur.com/a/fUA78by)

My tweet which eventually forced his reply: [https://twitter.com/Cri5\_09/status/1202190915990781953](https://twitter.com/Cri5_09/status/1202190915990781953)

Note: His twitter handle is [https://twitter.com/amitbhawani](https://twitter.com/amitbhawani) and he is the owner of Phoneradar.

Thanks.

&#x200B;

Update: I got a whatsapp message from a guy claiming to be from the PhoneRadar team. He apologizes and says its not Amit's fault as a lot of people falsely claim the phone. I am really pissed off at this point. Silly excuse, but I feel bad for the guy taking the fall for this.They are now saying they will ship the phone this weekend. Told him I dont care uch about the phone now. Oh, and this reddit post made a lot of noise. Thanks r/india. He is asking me to delete my  reddit posts and tweets! I said I am happy to add an update in the end to say I got the phone, but I am no way deleting my posts and tweets. Thats ridiculous 

Update 2: He deleted his tweet. 

Update 3: As you all might have seen from his recent tweet, I got an email from him apologizing for the issue. Perhaps the only good thing they have done so far. I asked him to send out prizes to all giveaway winners and update proofs on his website giveaway page. It hasn't been updated with winner names for a while now. 

Update 4: RIP inbox.

Thanks @sideonion for the gold. Really appreciate it. Thanks to Anon for the silver!

Update 5: Finally got the phone today. Had promised to gift it to my Sister for her birthday in September, got the phone on my birthday today. 
https://imgur.com/a/7VJhBfP 

Thank you so much r/india for all the support in making this happen. All your comments here and on Twitter(and on YouTube too) made it possible for me to finally get the phone. Proud of the community. Thank you :)"

WHO has been giving warnings from like January and even India's first case was 30th January. The government had enough time, many weeks to think and make a plan

They will be able to sustain this lockdown for only so many days given the miserable conditions they are living in right now without any savings.

Its as if the government entirely ignored the presence of 4.5 crore migrant labourers. This lockdown reduces the spread of Corona - It is not enough to fight that virus. People with savings might be able to sustain a multiple month lockdown. But for how long does the government expect migrant labourers to live like cattle fed once a day. Does human life have any value here?

The issue of migrant labourers being stuck in other states is like a ticking time bomb waiting to explode in our face."

Had an argument with some obnoxious colleagues in the morning. They are seniors who throw their weight around, and today spent 20 minutes shouting at a hapless office boy, for not keeping a glass of hot tea ready on their desk when they walked in.

They threatened to fire him and reduced him to tears.

I had enough and walked over to them and gave them their due piece of mind. I brought up the history of unacceptable treatment they've been meting out to the office boys and maids, snapping their fingers at them, abusing them over trivial matters, calling them for menial tasks they were well capable of doing themselves.

I stated very loudly that firing the office boys over flimsy charges would lead to cases in the labour court, and the office boy was stunned to know that was even an option.

The arrogant buddhas huffed and puffed and complained to the head of the office, who called me in. Since I work for the Corporate office and don't report to him, he couldn't boss me around, so he told me to calm down and not ""upset the seniors"" in the company. He told me that office boys were used to being treated this way, since ""it's part of their job"".

To anyone still reading, please rid yourselves of this attitude. Office boys and maids are human beings, not servants*. They deserve the same respect, dignity, and kindness you expect from your company.

Please make an effort to know their names (""Arre, Suno"" is not their name!!!!), talk to them once in a while, thank them when they make you a cup of tea, warm your food in the microwave, or come to your desk with some prasad or cake that some other colleague wishes to distribute in the office.

Wash your plates/containers/teacups after eating/drinking. Office is not a hotel, so it's not their duty to clean your utensils.

If you've spilled something on your desk/floor and they have to clean it, apologise to them for the inconvenience. 

If you have to stay back late for work, please take the office keys from them and offer to lock up the office yourself. They typically have to travel far to their home and have to report early to the office, so it's not fair for you to keep them waiting endlessly late in the day. Same for the Sundays when you have to report for duty.

Stand up for them if you see a colleague misbehaving or treating them callously. 

TLDR: Treat your office boys and maids like colleagues. Getting treated like shit is not part of their ""job"". Don't be a lazy slob and take care of minor things yourself in the office.

Thanks for reading, and apologies if I've offended anyone. 

*Edit: Just to add, servants should also be treated with respect and dignity. 

Edit Edit: Thank you for the gold, generous redditor. Definitely appreciate the gesture, but honestly, I don't deserve gold for this rant/ post. "

Be gentle with them and help them as much as you can. Don't be a bully.We are living in an awesome time, but there are still billions of people who have never accessed Internet in their life. And, many of them are coming online for the first time.

Just like how you were once new to the internet and you were amazed and puzzled by different things, they will also experience the same, but the difference is that they are like the new student who joined the school in the middle of the year. They have to now put twice as effort than you did in the past because everything has evolved so much and there are so many things to know about.

They are new to everything and they will be naive. They will fall into scams and will be exploited. They will be made fun of as they don't know the social etiquette of the internet which you have got used to. They may not even understand English properly or may not understand the underlying technologies which may seem obvious to you.

However, remember that you were also like that once up a time. Perhaps you were privileged to be able to use the internet while it was still a young new thing, but imagine how you would have felt if everyone you met online were a bully to you. Remember that Internet became what it is because there were forums and sites for helping each other on every topic you can think of.

I am saying this because I often see new users being abused by the Internet as the whole.

**Be gentle and welcome the new wave of Internet users.**"

I had got a good placement from my college campus selection, which the company just informed we won't be getting since the economic state of the company is not good for hiring any more people.

We weren't allowed to sit in any other placement as we can only participate in placement with a higher package than the ones we already have.

Now I(and some of my friends) have lost my only placement. 
I always had a plan to directly go for a jo after Btech and then decide what to do with my future. Now that that plan got absolutely ruined, what do I do?

I haven't written the GATE exam, nor am I preparing for any other such exams.
Going abroad also doesn't seem likely considering the current scenario.

My final question is: Is this batch of BTech pass outs officially ****ed?"

It has been a few years, and I've traveled to other places since, but lately memories from India have helped me stay strong.

Whether it be strolling in the ancient ruins around Hampi, Karnatka, climbing giant boulders and feeling like the king of the world;

Or drifting in the crazy haze of Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, feeling the insane energy of life and death strip me of my identity, as I become just another body in the crowd;

Watching the mists roll over the tea plantations in Munnar, Kerala, the light rain on my skin, and feeling inner peace;

Not being able to smile for my photo in front of the Taj Mahal, because I was overcome by beauty and grief;

Climbing to the top of the crowded waterfall in Bhagsu, Himachal Pradesh, and suddenly finding myself Isolated in a beautiful stream, alone save a solitary monk taking a bath in one of the pools;

walking around giant temple complexes in Tamil Nadu, Marveling at the dedication and power of their builders;

Being escorted by a friendly dog half way to the Kheerganga hot springs in Parvati valley, her patiently waiting for me every time I have to slow down;

Getting tremendous help from like 500 different beautiful people whenever I needed something, all over this country;

And finally, quietly sitting in the meditation room in the Buddha memorial park in Patna, Bihar, and finally accepting that it's time to go back home.


Thank you, India. Thank you for all these memories, and a thousand more. I love you and I miss you. Stay the crazy, unique, powerful, beautiful, **wonderful** place that you are.

So let me give a bit of a background first. I'm a 26 year old, general engineering male (GEM) candidate who has had poor past academics. Scored 88 in 10th, 66 in 12th, 60 in under graduation. In addition to that I had two year gaps in my engineering. Now before you come to any conclusion that I'm stupid or something, let me also mention that I was going through depression and did not study at all after 11th. It was only after 3rd year of engineering (2017) that I came out of it and managed to get things a little bit on track. Even getting overall 60% in UG was a huge ask but I managed that. Because 60% and 65% are some benchmarks used by colleges and recruiters.

I was ineligible for placements during my engineering and was not allowed to sit for any company because I had <60 at the time of recruitments. I managed to get to 60 only in the last exam at which time companies weren't coming for recruitment. So I wanted to go for higher education and took a year gap to study for GATE. Unfortunately I didn't do good enough and managed only 40/100. Was very down after this and didn't know what to do. At this time I had also given cat and scored 88%ile. I gave interviews for KJ Somaiya and Welingkar but wasn't selected. After talking to a lot of people I decided to go prepare for CAT one more year and give it my all.

Fast forward to CAT 2019. I scored 98.3%ile in CAT and 94%ile in XAT. Also shortlisted for IIFT. Messed up SNAP and missed the cutoff of NMIMS Mumbai by one mark. Anyway, I had applied to a whole lot of colleges, most of the top 40-45 colleges. I have already given most of the interviews, apart from a few which are most probably gonna scrap the interviews due to Corona. 

My concerns start from here. I did not manage to do good enough in interviews and group discussions. My main problem being poor social skills and stage fear. Even after a lot of practice I could only manage an average performance. Now the results are rolling out and I've realized how awful my performance in these was.

I wasn't selected for the PGDM program for IMT Ghaziabad, but was offered their Dual Country Program (which costs over 26lacs). Also got rejected by IMI New Delhi and IIM Rohtak. I have given interviews for new and baby IIMs, Nitie, MDI, IIFT and await their results.

My questions to you-
1) Should I go for IMT DCP( one year in Dubai, one year in Ghaziabad)? Points to be considered- average placement 13lpa, total fees over 26lacs, total batch size 500-600
2a)  If I go for it, how should I prepare myself before the course begins so I get an advantage in placements?
2b)  If I don't go for it, what could be my alternatives, considering getting a job is extremely tough in this environment?
3) Apart from all this, what should I do to become a better professional? What resources can I make use of?"

### Tl; dr

IFF’s Working Paper on [***Privacy Prescriptions for Technology Interventions on COVID-19 in India***](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UK5rElhcdP5T3Y-8fYP6cCgQKKpQBeOX/view), affords significant space to the issue of contact tracing technologies. In Chapter 8 it offers a preliminary breakdown of the recently announced partnership between Apple and Google to provide a digital contact tracing solution. In this post we provide some insights into our working paper’s analysis of the partnership through the lens of what’s good, possible risks and the project’s relevance for India. For more texture, please read our working paper, and feel free to provide us with feedback on how we can improve our findings.

### Background | The Promise of Scale and Privacy

Even as the Aarogya Setu application [**crosses the 50 million download mark**](https://theprint.in/tech/aarogya-setu-is-fastest-app-in-the-world-to-reach-50-million-users-despite-privacy-concerns/403025/), there is another project which people should take notice of. On April 10, 2020 Apple and Google [**announced**](https://www.apple.com/in/newsroom/2020/04/apple-and-google-partner-on-covid-19-contact-tracing-technology/) a partnership where they will collaborate on an interoperable contact tracing partnership. Considering they are the world’s two largest operating system (OS) providers for smartphones, they have the scale to potentially offer these facilities to in excess of 3 billion users globally.

The companies are positioning the system as a voluntary opt in system. It will be designed to notify users if they have come in contact with an infected individual. Subsequently, it will offer users recommended courses of action which may range from quarantine to self isolation.

This development essentially reflects earlier recommendations of technologists and stakeholders. Since these are pre existing infrastructures, stakeholders suggest that it may be a viable alternative to creating new surveillance systems installed and monitored by government.

In particular OS providers have been viewed as a promising alternative since these parties have considerable experience in deploying privacy-preserving technologies like differential privacy or homomorphic encryption.

### Proposed Timelines

Demonstrating the long term nature of the global response to COVID-19, and the way contact tracing systems are increasingly linked with the reopening of future economic activities, the plan is to introduce the system in two phases.

1. In **Phase 1** (to commence in **May, 2020**) public health authorities will be given the capability to run apps in which iPhones and Android phones will be able exchange information anonymously with one another. The design will allow users of the public health app to voluntarily notify the system if they test positive for COVID-19. Then users which were in close proximity in the last few days will be notified that such contact was made. The default timeline for this check will be 14 days. However, health authorities will have the discretion to amend this.
2. **Phase 2** will be administered over the course of a few months. This update to the programme will essentially reflect the recommendations discussed earlier. The contact tracing software will be embedded into the operating system itself, which removes the need for users to download an application. This functionality will also be opt-in but the potential for this solution to scale is enormous and brings with its own set of opportunities and risks.

### The Project Emphasises Individual Privacy

To reassure people on privacy, Google and Apple stressed on the fact that consent will be baked into its design and they will not collect location data. To their credit, after the publication of our working paper the two parties have [**announced**](https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-and-google-say-they-will-shut-down-covid-19-tracking-tools-once-pandemic-ends/) that they intend to terminate the systems once the COVID-19 pandemic ends. While this is a good step, given the uncertain nature of timelines in relation to the coronavirus there is a need for greater specificity and transparency on this front, and is not enough to allay concerns of permanence.

Coming to technical aspects of the project, it stresses that users will not be informed whom they came in contact with, or where the contact takes place. The companies will also not be able to access this data and the entire system can be shut down, if required.  Similar to Singapore’s *TraceTogether* application and other global projects discussed in IFF’s Working Paper the proposed project will be based on Bluetooth. Once contact is established, devices exchange anonymous device identifiers (which are updated for every user’s device on a daily basis), which confirm a timestamped interaction. To enhance people’s privacy, anonymous digital identifiers will change roughly every fifteen minutes. The [**inconsistency**](https://internetfreedom.in/is-aarogya-setu-privacy-first-nope-but-it-could-be-if-the-government-wanted/) with the Aarogya Setu app’s own efforts at privacy protections, data minimisation and obfuscation is apparent.

Should an individual test positive for COVID-19, the person has the ability to enter their diagnosis into a corresponding app which is designed for health agencies. This application then must seek the consent of users to export their “close proximity” interactions which have been recorded in the days prior to diagnosis. This data which has been exported is stored temporarily in a remote server for 14 days. Again here it shows the level of agency and control being afforded to people and their personal data. Indeed, this ethos has even been reflected in other promising contact tracing models studied by our Working Paper.

When it comes to the devices of the people who have made contact with this diagnosed person, the process flow is as follows. First the phone will check the server periodically to assess if any of its identifier keys are linked with COVID-19 positive cases. All positive keys are downloaded back on to this individual’s phone and matched anonymously for validation purposes. When matched, a notification is sent to the other person’s phone along with suggestions from health agencies on how they can quarantine and self-isolate.

The project aims to create a common standard of interaction between different technologists and public health authorities across the world. The two firms state that privacy, transparency and consent will be underlying pillars of this project. The actual solution will also be informed by the inputs of other stakeholders. To further transparency, they have published specifications for Bluetooth, cryptography (i.e. encryption) and API frameworks. As of now information on accountability mechanisms remains difficult to discern.

### Risks Arising from the Project

One of the large outcomes of the coronavirus’ impact in relation to people’s increased dependence on information and communication technologies provided by big tech companies. Considering the fact that contact tracing solutions require the processing of highly sensitive personal information including health records, and insights on people’s movements and/or interpersonal communications, there is an added layer of complexity when these systems are managed by private sector behemoths. It is imperative that any private sector driven response to digital contact tracing must adequately tackle issues of transparency, consent, purpose limitation, and corporate objectives.

When private actors are entrusted for such projects, there is a need to engender public trust. Name recognition and brand of course, help with this trust, but trust also covers facets like safety, privacy and reliability. At a minimum these businesses must also have to comply on principles of (1) specific limited purpose, where there is a specified end data and a defined outcome to the project; (2) complete transparency; and (3) strong enforcement mechanisms which can hold these businesses accountable and protect people’s fundamental rights to informational privacy.

Stringent checks and balances are important to consider, since the creation of new systems, even if they are characterised as temporary, are difficult to roll back. Aside from these general risks, when analysing the project announced by Apple and Google, we must stay vigilant in a few distinct ways.

* **Negotiating Government Use of Personal Data:** The project discusses a system wherein once users of the application are diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, they can export their records from the prior few days on to an external server. This external server allows public health officials to access relevant records. Since, this means health departments in governments are granted access to people’s personal data, there is an onus to ensure use limitations.  Under the guise of contact tracing, health authorities should not be allowed to share such information and insights towards civil liberty restrictions. For example, Apple and Google will have to update the public on how its systems can and cannot be used by governments.
* **Issues of Competition and Conflict of Interest:** Competition authorities and policymakers must carefully scrutinise this project, in an ex-ante manner. This is because it may severely deter competition and innovation in a crucial area of urgent public interest. There is a need to consider conflicts of interest at two levels. In the project’s first phase, Apple and Google will be competing with other applications developed by other groups, companies, consortiums, researchers, and governments. In this context, there is a need for oversight on how *App Store* and *Play Store* treats its application(s) in comparison to other similar solutions.  Second, as the project evolves and integrates itself into the operating system, we need to evaluate what it will mean for innovation in the space. Does the project envision a means to be interoperable with other operating system providers in smartphone and feature phone markets. Such systems should not leave us in a paradigm with one digital contact tracing solution where large technology firms and governments have unimpeachable control over the system. To mitigate such risks, there may be an overriding need to administer ex-ante impact assessments-- both economic and rights oriented.
* **Should Such Projects Be Administered by Pureplay Corporate Structures:** At a fundamental level, it is also important to consider the validity of such projects being administered in a purely corporate structure. Considering the overarching public interest in global responses to COVID-19 and the human rights implications of contact tracing, should these solutions and the supporting infrastructures, be categorised as public digital infrastructures? Instead, should there be regulated access to public-private models? Or should it merely be regulated opportunities for private actors to participate? While the model remains unknown, there is a need to have an expedited conversation on this front.

### Relevance for India and What’s Next?

It is important to highlight that India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) is undertaking a consultation which is relevant to this issue. In particular under May 31, 2020 stakeholders may submit suggestions to a white paper toward a national strategy on National Open Digital Ecosystems. IFF’s submission will address the whitepaper/consultation’s interlinkages with such conversations in its substantive response.

Based on public feedback, IFF intends to update its findings and recommendations to its working paper and share it directly with stakeholders involved in crucial decision making processes.

Every time someone mentions that the number of Covid cases are low in India, you are likely to meet the ""We aren't doing enough testing"" quote.   
When you consider the data point of ""tests per million"", you will see India faring quite bad but again most of the other countries aren't dealing with a huge population crisis or even the vastness of a country like ours.   
So don't you think no matter how many tests we conduct we are anyways going to fare lowly in that metric point ? So my question is why are we complaining about the low number of tests per million and is it actually a valid data point for us to ponder over ?

I was thinking about how cooking food requires daily interaction with local grocers for veggies and wanted to compare it with ordering food under lockdown. PS I can do both. 

1. Supposing delivery executives do 15orders a day, they get to interact with 30 different people. A grocer will be interacting daily with suppliers and customers and the count would be much higher.

2. You going to the grocer means interacting directly with a potential carrier(since they are interacting with more people). You meeting a delivery executive should be lower risk because the executive would at max be an intermediate carrier and and 2nd degree.

3. Todays case the employee was a a Box8 employee. I am not sure if they are as strict and vigilant as swiggy or zomato.

4. Ordering meat dishes will always be more nutritious than cooking eggs and veggies provided the cost is affordable.

5. The only con I can think of with delivery executives is that they will be driving to all parts of the city, even potential virus hotspots. You grocer will be in your locality. His suppliers might come from other parts but in this case grocer becomes 2nd degree. The suppliers and customers would also be almost same everyday while for delivery executives they would almost certainly be meeting different people every day.

My mind is biased towards ordering and so I wanted to get some counter arguments and whether my line of thinking is correct here. Currently I order only curry while I make rice/roti at home. This makes me order once or twice in two days. If you are ordering rice/roti/noodles your mileage will decrease both in cost and quantity."

Sure the Indian society looks down upon you and laughs at you and education isn't encouraged at such ""old age"" by societies standards, but I took the plunge. Here's my backstory - I graduated high school in 2012. Scored a rank of 718 in Wbjee 2013 and took up chemical engineering at Jadavpur University. My father lost his job in 2014 due to mental illness and I had a passion for photography. I started working as a freelancer photographer to meet ends. I couldn't attend classes and by 2015, I had 12 backlogs. I decided to drop out and realised chemical engineering isn't for me. Made some good progress in my photography career. Shot few promotional events with Kareena Kapoor,Ajay Devgan,Govinda,etc. But opportunities became bleaker as I didnt have the money to expand on my equipments and upgrade and hence by 2017 photography was totally a failure. People suggested me to go back and finish my degree. My cousin sponsored my studies and I went back to JU, but I hated chemical engineering. Depression happened and by mid 2018 I had 22 backlogs. I wasnt just simply interested in it. Took the year off to recover from my depression, gave wbjee this year and now I am starting a btech in cse from a tier-3 college. So by the time I graduate I will be 29.
I really love front end web development at the moment. So let's see where the future leads me. A lot of you might ask, why I am going for a bachelor's degree, I could have learnt coding and got a job in six months. Honestly, there are no shortcuts in life. I wouldn't want to be a 35/40/50/60 year old who lost his job and is unemployable now just because he doesn't have a bachelor's degree. 
I have seen a lot of posts here by people who are 24-30 and non graduates and they ask for help. This is for those people, even if society makes u feel like a failure, don't let your mind accept that. Because, u can't change your past, but you can plan and act in the present to build a better future. Dwelling on the past won't change anything. I saw lots of posts from people in their mid 30s to 50s on Facebook job post groups, where they took up a job(without going for a graduation degree) and now at a much older age they are without any job and much options. A smart man learns from his own mistakes, a wise man learns from the mistakes of others. I don't know why our society stigmatises going back to school at an old age, but in USA people graduate even in their 50s. Age is just a number, don't let society come in between your life and your dreams. Failure isn't fatal, Success isn't final. It is the courage to go on that counts. Don't let the past define you. Today is a new day. Start again :)


Thanks,


Failure at 25.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST) here, has developed a much cheaper and faster diagnostic test kit (Chitra Gene LAMP-N), which is highly confirmatory for the diagnosis of COVID-19 that has claimed over 400 lives in the country.*

*The test kit can detect the ""N Gene of SARS COV2 using reverse transcriptase loop-mediated amplification of viral nucleic acid (RT-LAMP). We are not aware of anybody else in the world doing lamp for N gene for coronavirus, Institute Director,"" Dr Asha Kishore told PTI.*

*This technology is much cheaper, faster, can check 100 per cent matching with PCR (Polymerase chain reaction) and accuracy. It will be very easy to deploy it across the country, being very cost-effective, she said. ""This will be one of the world's first few if not the first confirmatory diagnostic test for N gene of SARS-CoV-2 using the RT-LAMP technique.*

*------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

*The test kit which is highly specific for SARS-CoV-2 N-gene can detect two regions of the gene which will ensure that the test does not fail even if one region of the viral gene undergoes mutation during its current spread,"" a press release from the institute said.*

*The institute has informed the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) about the test kit and is awaiting approval. Using Chitra Gene LAMP-N,* ***the gene detection time is 10 minutes and the sample to result time (from RNA extraction in swab to RT-LAMP detection time) will be less than two hours***\*,she said, adding 30 samples can be tested in a single batch in a single machine.\*

*The significantly lower machine waiting time will allow large number of samples to be tested each day in a single machine in multiple shifts, she said.*

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The kit was developed by a team led by Dr Anoop Thekkuveettil, a senior Scientist of the Biomedical Technology Wing of the Institute and scientist-in-charge of the division of molecular medicine under the Department of Applied Biology, in the last three weeks.*

*The new device for LAMP testing costs around* ***Rs 2.5 lakh*** *and the test kit for two regions of N gene(including RNA extraction)* ***will be less than Rs 1000/test,*** *while the RT PCR machine costs around* ***Rs 15 lakh to Rs 40 lakh*** *and the PCR kit cost is* ***Rs 1900-2500/test.***

*The testing facility can be easily set up even in the laboratories of district hospitals with limited facilities and trained laboratory technicians,Dr Asha said.*

Long form: So I wanted to purchase a chocolate powder and I have tried both in the past so I was wondering which to buy this time. 

For 215 you get the 500 gms horlicks powder which is pretty good. And for 210 you get 150 gms cadbury powder. The choice seems obvious. Plus Cocoa is bitter so the cadbury powder requires you to add more sugar to make your chocolate shake more pleasant. But since I have nothing better to do today I went deeper.

The Horlics nutrition chart shows that each 100gms contain 78gm carbs of which 30gms are sugar.

Cadbury shows each 100gms contain 52gm carb of which 1.7gm is sugar. 

That means that horlics is 30% sugar. and cadbury is 1% sugar. 

30 fucking percent sugar? fuck that. 

Lets go even deeper.

With cadbury I usually toss in a little under 1 tablespoon powder (10 gms) with a  teaspoon of sugar in my milkshake (4gms)

With horlics I usually toss in 2 big tablespoon powder (~30 gms). so thats 9gms sugar? Sometimes I add more sugar. idk. 

Lets go per serving now.

With cabury, 1 serving = 10 gms. so one box is 15 servings?

With horlicks, 1 serving - 30 gms. So one box is 16.5 servings

So I bought the cocoa.

You can make the comparison yourself:

Since it was Chinese New Year holidays, I thought I’ll head to Bali (via HK) for a short vacay and then head back to Shenzhen.
As the news of the epidemic becoming severe, I decided to go back to Bangalore,India.

This is where the fun starts:
- ON FEBRUARY 6, I land in Bangalore and the doctor in front of the immigration asks me where am I coming from and I say Bali and he let’s me go. (No temperature checks)
- at immigration, the officer doesn’t check my travel/visa history at all and I had to report myself that I live in China, the officer takes me to another officer and he just lets me pass immigration as they were instructed to only check folks who have a travel history to China after Jan 24

A week later I have a bad cold (I have a weak immunity) and since I have a crazy travel history and didn’t want to take risk and endanger people, so I call the helpline and they ask me if I spoke any Hindi (I didn’t) and they disconnected..
So I went to the official government center (Rajiv Gandhi chest diseases hospital) and report myself.
The staff were friendly and professional and they took my samples and took a chest X-ray and they found air-blockages around my chest and suspected it would be a pneumonia.So I was isolated and quarantined.

My family were not happy that I reported myself and the hospital ‘held’ me in quarantine for 2 days until my results came back ‘negative’ for the virus.

The quarantine facility  was not super great but clean and adequate and the staff took good care of me, provided meals and medicine on time until my results came out.
I was not allowed to go out of the isolation building and the family was not recommended to meet me, the silver lining is that the building was well lit with sunlight and you could hear birds chirping all day and you’re away from all the bangalore hustle and bustle.
It was a giant relief for me that the test results came out negative since I live in a joint family here in Blr.

TLDR; 
- travelled around a lot
- officers at the immigration were not very serious about the virus situation
- felt sick, reported myself and got quarantined in the government hospital 
- quarantine was not bad at all
- results for covid-2019 came back negative 

If you have symptoms, report yourself."

There are offices where senior managers harass / shout at juniors, there are colleges where senior students rag juniors, there are school teachers who make fun of students who are not so good at studies and so on.

In many of the cases, I have seen that seniors harass juniors only because they were themselves harassed in the past by their own seniors. Many managers pick up the habit of shouting at juniors because they were shouted at too, when they were juniors. Do you see the problem here? - This cycle is never going to stop. One able person will harass another - this person will then harass someone else  and this will keep continuing.

So here is my request - BREAK THE CHAIN. Try to be polite to people (especially juniors around you). Try not to vent out your frustration on your maid. When you shout on her, she may not reply you, but she is definitely going to shout at someone else that day to vent out her frustration (perhaps she might shout at her kids). This will slowly start to have impact and I am hopeful people will get healthier work environments. Remember that Indians are very low in the happiness index list, and with small efforts from our side, we can improve."

Following is the text of the tweet, verbatim:

""A Jamati died of Corona when police and doctors went to check their families they were attacked and killed, make these mullas + secular media stand in a line and shoot them dead... F**k history. They may call us Nazis who cares, life is more important than fake image."" [1]

Rangoli Chandel was followed on Twitter by over 100 thousand people. The tweet remained for everyone to see for almost a whole day. It was retweeted 1497 times and liked by over 5600 people.

Last year, in the wake of the Pulwama attack, Kangana Ranaut had said this of Shabana Azmi and Pakistan:

""The film industry is full of such anti-nationals who boost enemies' morals in many ways, but right now is the time to focus on decisive actions. Pakistan's ban is not the focus, Pakistan's destruction is."" [2]

Earlier this year, the Indian government awarded Kangana Padma Shri, the country's 4th highest civilian honor. 

Following this latest incident, if not a Padma award, it is entirely plausible that Rangoli could at least snag a BJP ticket in an upcoming election. 

Jai Hind."

Here are some thoughts on thisFirst of all  It's a feature not a bug. And is being consistently working towards its goal.

The way media is behaving in last few years, it seems we are inching more and more towards a totalitarian form of government. The idea that media can be effectively used to control and sway public sentiments is not new. One of the earliest major successes stories when the media was used in this manner comes from Nazi Germany. I will quote some relevant paragraphs from [Mein Kampf](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.54153/page/n3/mode/2up) (particularly Chapter 6 War Propaganda) which seems to be like the cookbook for our present incumbents.

Second it is not dumb. In case you are wondering that the ""intellectual level"" of the media has dropped, it is talking to the masses who are not ""intellectual"". It is by design that the content has been ""dumbed down""

> To whom should  propaganda be addressed? To the scientifically trained intelligentsia or to the less educated masses? 

> It must be addressed always and exclusively to the masses. 

> What the intelligentsia — or those who today unfortunately 
often go by that name — what they need is not propaganda but scientific instruction. The content of propaganda is not science  any more than the object represented in a poster is art.

> All propaganda must be popular and its intellectual level must be adjusted to the most limited intelligence among those it is addressed to. Consequently, the greater the mass it is intended to reach, the lower its purely intellectual level will have to be. 

> It is not the purpose of propaganda to provide a series of thrills with a view to pleasing these blase gentry. Its chief function is to convince the masses, whose slowness of understanding needs to be given time in order that they may absorb information; and only constant repetition will finally succeed in imprinting an idea on the memory of the crowd. 


About the persistence of the themes, the Hindu-Muslim divide, the ""other"",

> Any variation must not alter the main theme of the propaganda, but must always emphasize the same point. The slogan must, of course, be illustrated in many ways and from several angles, but in the end the stress must always be laid on the slogan itself. In this way alone can propaganda be consistent and dynamic in its effects. 

> Only by following these general lines and sticking to them steadfastly, with uniform and concise emphasis, can final success be reached. Then we shall be rewarded by the surprising and almost incredible results that such a persistent policy secures. The success of any advertisement, whether of a business or a political nature, depends on the consistency and perseverance with which it is employed.

This morning I woke up to the sounds of an argument between the landlord and my father. The landlord was asking us not to use one specific bathroom because it was leaking. The landlord is a pretty chill uncle, so I was surprised to hear him shouting.The argument was pretty one-sided though. So, I wake up and do my daily duties and that's when my mom comes to me to have a real talk. 

She says that we haven't paid the rent for about 8 months now and she figures that the landlord might ask us to vacate the place. She says your father hasn't been able to provide any income and shakingly admits that she's been asking relatives and people she knows money, to make ends meet.
She says that my education was supported by taking loans from relatives and that we're deep in debt, about 10 lakhs.

A little background about my family:
We're a family of three, my father moved to this city in 1995 because of his job (reputed company) and so did my mother after getting married. Things were going pretty good until 2005 when the company announced that they had to merge two branches and the branch in our city will be closed off. They were asking my father to transfer to another city, but keeping my education in mind my parents decided it's best for us to stay here, so my father resigned. My mother, a teacher, was also the earning member.
At this point in the story, my father is about 40 years old and my mother is around 33 years old and I'm 7 years old. My father lands a job in a different company, it's a different job than what he's used to, he doesn't like it. A few years later, the company is forced to close due to losses and my father was laid off. 
My father was unemployed for about a year and my mother became the primary earning member. She teaches Yoga as a home tutor. My mother handled things for a few years. Fast forward a few years, my father joins my uncle's company, a completely different job this time, and moves to a different city. It has been this way for about 7 years now, things were starting to get back on track, but my father left the job saying the bosses there suck and he can't lick their boots for a petty job. I was aware of this and I was in 4th year of my engineering at this time and I graduated a year later with a job in my hand. The job requires me to stay away from my home city and has a 1 year training period, after which I'll be considered an employee of the company. 

Cut to the question:
I was brought up without any of these circumstances affecting me, I never knew about all of this until today and that too only because the landlord came to have an argument and I happened to be awake at that time.

I really adore my mother and father, imagining how hard my mother worked to get me educated brings tears to my eyes. My mother cannot have a proper talk with father about his employment because she's afraid he might break down mentally.

I choose bcom and LLB because I had no option. I have 0 passion for law. I don't want a job ever in my life. I would die of starvation, than have a job or start business. Business is out of my league.

My IQ is below 90 and I am ugly, so I have lost before I was born. I can end cycle of cursed genetics by not breeding and end my kinship.

I always knew, since I was a child that I was dumb.



I have spent my last 3 years in isolation and felt like heaven. I avoided my family, friends and lived inside my head daydreaming. Now I feel like my life is over.







I have no desire to succeed in life. I don't want to earn money nor help people or basically do anything. I never win at anything. I don't try new things, because I always mess everything up. I don't like to be around family, friends and humans in general.
I hate myself and wonder what drives people to achieve things in life? Are they special? Are they god gifted? Are they lucky? From where confidence comes? High IQ? Good genetics inherited from their parents?

Life is so unfair.

I never thought, I would have lived till 22. When I was young, I always bad in back of my mind that I would be dead before I start a job."

I came to this city on 16th march in a private vehicle, not with public transport.I m staying at my aunt's house since then.  But due to lockdown, the admission (NEET PG) got postponed. But they have resumed it through online method.  

Now here's the problem. This place has a hell lot of mosquitoes. Tonight i had high grade fever with chills and rigor. No coughing, sneezing or breathing issues of any kind.I m highly suspicious that it is malaria. If i tell my aunt, she will panic, and will ask me to leave. If i stay here, I won't be cured, bz, no matter what i try, I can't get rid of mosquitoes (this house doesn't has a mosquito net). And if i go to a hospital and get admitted, my aunt won't accept me back once i m discharged. I don't know what to do.
Although i can get myself tested for malaria and start the treatment, if it's positive, on my own, hiding the fact from my aunt's family and hoping for recovery in this mosquito infested locality. 
For the record, I don't go out of the house, have been practicing social distancing, and as of today this city has zero COVID19 patients. Please suggest something."

My sincere thought was and is still that - whatever desk jobs can be done through Work from home(WFH) should be done in that way without any loosening of screws - which the govt seems to be doing now. 

Especially for IT sector employees who are working from home and thereby not putting undue stress on a societal level even inadvertently - on their fellow colleagues, office staff, their own health, their near ones health and the greater population - especially for  them who are actually equipped to do WFH , why the rush to loosen up everything now as if after 20th April, Covid19 would magically disappear.

I don't really know what to write  anymore in this.

And they are not the only ones that have this kind of attitude to the larger population that is Hindu. There are many such Islamic congregations that operate under the same sense of autonomy from the state.

But instead of focusing on those bearded lungi-wallas we should look at the funders of such programs in India. And this is not the only country that is being funded to make its muslims more conservative and Wahabbi. Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, everyone of these countries is prey to this.

Where is all this funding coming from? Follow the money, dammit! Oldest rule in the book when you're investigating a crime.

When will Arknb and the rest -- including the so called Left Media, Wire, Print, NDTV, Hindu -- speak out against Saudi funding for Wahabbi hardline Muslim dogma in our country that has already rotted a big chunk of its population?

Uber, Ola: No way to contact customer service directly, have to submit ticket and wait for them to call you. The drivers are all corrupt, 8/10 (bangalore) they will call you up to ask for your destination (which they are not supposed to know) then if they dont like it or if you refuse to tell them they will waste your time sitting in some gully trying to force you to cancel. Yes, it is 8 times out of 10, i am not exaggerating.

&#x200B;

Swiggy, zomato etc - complete garbage. They take the payment but take 0 real responsiblity for what is delivered. Have had 500 rs orders only half delivered, and they refuse to replace or refund giving me a 50 rupee coupon for 250 rupees worth of missing items. Like what the fuck is that? If I wanted to just give away money id stand on a bridge and throw it.

Pizza hut, dominos, other international chains: Completely 100% indianized, only chicken (religous issue? even UAE pizza hut has pork on their menu), KFC removes fries from its menu (but they sell burgers, wtf? and fries are known, world around, to be the highest margin fast food item).

Electricians, handymen, plumbers: never on time, show up whenever they want, get upset when you say you are now busy. Cant install taps correctly (hot is cold, cold is hot), too near the sink so to get water on your hands you have to touch the sink, poor earthing.

ISPs: shit customer service all-round, high speed, yes, but poor connections with high latency, blocking of websites (disgusting to freedom of information)

Mobile service providers: cheap AF, completely overbooked, infrastructure cant cater to the number of people they take on, get 0.2mbps 4g in metros like mg road bangalore even at 2 o clock on a weekday night.

Autos: meter is just for show, at least in bangalore, aggressive, misbehaved if you dont haggle with them off the meter. Dont even know the roads properly.

Cops: useless 100%, show they are advanced with twitter, facebook and incident report apps, 0% response rate (tried to report noise level issue in my area from a nearby construction site, over 30 complaints over 2 months, tweets, facebook messages, no response. One time a cop showed up wasted more of my time than doing anything, takes my picture for some reason, and fucks off.

Even other poorer nations, and other 3rd world countries, are not as shit as ours when it comes to decenly and proper service, public behaviour, etc. This is the shittiest country in the world, to be honest, fuck your Indian pride (proud of what?).

I issue a first class pass but as there were only 20 people I joined the queue and waited for my turn. A lady came rushing and went straight to the window , at this moment 10-12 mins must have passed and queue was growing as 2 major trains depart and morning rush hour had begun.
I requested her to join the line and got a reply “train is about to come , will miss it” . I said everyone waiting is to board the same train and I informed the ticket guy to not issue a ticket to her. At last she had to leave and she shouted the words “Idiot bastard” and rushed away shedding her pride. Am I the idiot/bastard in this case ? Why do people get offended when they are being simply told to explain simple rules every citizen has to follow. I know this is very common but I am more offended coz of her retaliation.

  So this is about my brother who is an assistant manager in a PSU (public sector undertaking).Its a good secure job but there is a strong  chance  that this company might be privatised within 10 years.After passing out from his college my brother  was placed in an IT Company but he didn't  take that  up  because he wanted a secure govt. job.His CGPA is 8.2 and gre score  is 334 so he is very sure he will  get admission to a tier 1 university.   

His first problem is that he is a EC (electronics and communication)graduate and doesn't have much knowledge of computer science and doesn't have any significant coding experience.The only  language he knows is C++.  So he is concerned whether he will be able to cope up acdemically.
 The second (possible) obstacle is his age.He is almost 30 years old now and by the time he will have completed his MS he will be 32.Will this be a problem in getting a job in the US?( he doesn't want a job in India)
  
Our third concern is the current scenario in US with the coronavirus and possible  changes to the H1b visa process.Will this affect his chances  ?

Coronavirus,0.0,0.00904238382638623,0.0,1.0096136154592095,"The case for Covid-19 cases in IndiaAlright, since there’s a lot going on, let’s start with the basics:
A Quick recall: A new virus strain emerges out of the Wuhan Province of China last December, China declares it on Jan 1, then WHO declares it a ‘Public health Emergency’ on 30th January, then a pandemic on 11th March (A Pandemic is rapid spread of a disease amidst a large populace, within a short interval of time, spanning multiple continents).
Mass hysteria follows, as it usually does these days. Experts suggest social distancing as the best way to ensure lower spread of disease, forcing the government to finally act and ensure shutdown measures, so that our especially overwhelmed healthcare system doesn’t get even more so.
The name of this Novel (new) Coronavirus is now SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) since it being a cousin(not sibling, for that’s reserved for its mutations) of the SARS Coronavirus, a virus responsible for the 2003 SARS pandemic which spread primarily in the South Eastern Countries, and caused 770 deaths and 8000 infected people worldwide;

Here’s the case, since this is a new virus in town, we cannot possibly diagnose an infected person without testing him/her, this is NOT a seasonal fever/flu virus, this is 10 times deadlier, and has an incubation period (time it can stay alive inside human body) of 14 days, unlike the 3 days of seasonal flu.
Also, a person who is a carrier(who has the virus inside, but doesn’t fall sick) will be better able to spread the virus, compared to a sick person who gets noticed and screened out!
Best example of this being the 19 year old (way out of high-risk age groups of 60 years & above) Pizza Delivery guy, with no foreign travel history, in Delhi who tested positive, resulting in 70 families being quarantined.
Point I am trying to make here is that, that you can’t confirm Covid-19 cases, until you have enough Covid-19 tests done.
India’s share of Covid-19 tests is 0.2 for every 1000 people!
The Math: Total population of our country being 1,350,689,521, divided by 2,86,714 number of tests (according to last night’s data) would be 4710.92, which per thousand, is 0.21.
Meaning India has only conducted 0.2 tests per 1000 people, one of the lowest in the world, and the lowest in per capita.
Concurrently, the places with highest number of cases also are the ones who conducted the most number of tests, which isn’t mere coincidence.
The Propaganda: As of writing this, India has 13,425 positive cases with 446 deaths, and 1756 recovered, which is being hailed as monumental achievement, compared to other developed countries who have much more sophisticated healthcare systems than we can even imagine. This narrative being pushed by the Authorities is even bigger reason to worry than the pandemic since it is based on either them duping themselves, or the people, either way, we all lose.

The dunning Kruger: Dr RR Gangakhedkar of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has said in a statement that, India is conducting 24 test for every one positive case diagnosed, which is much higher than Japan’s 11.7, Italy’s 6.7, & US’ 5.3. Quite frankly this metric escapes my understanding, because:

If we can conduct tests for 24 individuals for every single positive case, and if the growth trends in the cases follow, then we’ll be able to test each and every one of 1.3 billion citizens in a couple of weeks. Not sure there are currently enough test kits in the world, let alone in India, for pulling off such a feat.

Say out of a sample of 500 of such 24 individuals’ tests, we get one positive case(optimistically speaking), then currently we have 1,12,557 infected people who haven’t been diagnosed yet, a number which will significantly spike, by the time they are identified, let alone tested."

Yeah Yeah i know its bad form to downplay corona virus right now.

But if the mortality rate is **0.2%** in **10 - 39** range and **0.4%** in **39-40** range then the overall mortality rate would be about **0.32 - 0.35% in under 50 range.**

Why not let people under 50 to go back to work with the obvious restrictions ....compulsory face mask and gloves ....some social distancing ....safeguards like temperature check ...companies that allow only under 50 years aged employees to work and also implement basic safeguards to be allowed to function after getting permission from authorities etc ...

I mean according to \[govt of india figures\]( [http://www.cghr.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Causes\_of\_death\_2001-03.pdf](http://www.cghr.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Causes_of_death_2001-03.pdf)/ )

In the age group 25-69, the leading causes of death in this age group are:

Cardiovascular diseases (25%), ¾

COPD, asthma, other respiratory (10.2%),

Tuberculosis (10.1%),

Malignant and other neoplasms (9%),

Symptoms signs and ill-defined conditions (5.3%),

Digestive diseases (5.1%),

Diarrhoeal diseases (5%)

Unintentional injuries: Other (4.6%),

Intentional self-harm or suicide (3%),

and Malaria (2.8%).

**India** \- **Adult mortality rate** between age 15 and 60

In 2015, **adult mortality rate** for **India** was 31.43 deaths per 100 population.

so even if we end up with 25% of the allowed adult population (0-49 years) infected with corona virus over the next 6 months ....the mortality rate is only 0.35% - which means death toll of 95,000 or 0.007% of population

Keep in mind 90% of corona virus infections are asymptomatic - so only 4-5% of the infected actually end up needing hospitalization.

Ok ....you can shoot me down now and say i am missing the point and have got it all wrong.

Just be gentle."

This was a particular recurring scene where he says ""Disney Facts"" over a set of jokes.

Hotstar is doing this even after being paid for a premium subscription. Similar censorship has happened in the past after Disney acquisition.

Edit : 
This blew up more than I thought it would. NDTV published an article on this reddit post. Hope hotstar stops censoring. Great going guys!

Although, he still doesn't see a viable alternative to Narendra Modi as the PM, he also started to acknowledge that Kejriwal is doing in his own words, ""some good things in Delhi that media isn't reporting""

I'm just trying to find others intrested in geopolitics and international relations and have (what could be) a wonderful discussion.

Post the pandemic, China is gonna be facing a shit storm and India is definitely a country they want on their side.

China is being ""kind and generous"" to India with donations of protective gear and has also promised to help produce ventilators, etc. 
India on the other hand has not blamed China for the outbreak dispite the followers of the populist govt. criticizing china and (what appears to be state backing) media shit talking about china too.

Sino-Indian relationship has always been mature and dignified, unlike Indo-Pak relations. And both India and China are wonderful at playing their cards on the geopolitical table.

Given the situation, and the slightly underwhelming govt and it's international relations, what do you think India will get out of this situation ?

Will the govt. be content with masks and ventilators? 
Will they push as far as permanant membership in P5 (possibly ruining relations with japan) (unlikely, I know.) ?
Is it likely India will criticize and blame china for lack of transparency and take a moral high (and diplomatic relations low) road ?  
How far do you think India will go ?

Keep in mind that the last time China fucked up (1990s after Tiananmen square) India pushed for Peace and Tranquility Agreement.

I took in two stray kittens, they mostly stay indoors but sometimes go outside. A few months ago I was feeding them boiled chicken and one of their teeth touched my finger, I wasn't sure if I bled but I went to the hospital, told them what happened. They gave me 4 shots on days 0,3,7 and 28 and asked me to get a booster a year later. Today while I was about to go out, one of them bit me on the leg through pants. I was wearing thick jeans at the time but I did feel her teeth, I went outside but I had a bit of realization 10 minutes in and decided to check my leg. I couldn't find a wound, I dont believe she penetrated through the clothes and it didnt seem like that strong of a bite either. But I still washed it with soap and water about 20 minutes after I got the bite and then I went to the hospital. The doctor there didn't even know what days they were supposed to administer the doses and kept confusing me but then he started writing the 4 dose vaccine again and I told him I already took it 2 months ago. Then he said I don't need anything and simply recommended me a tetanus shot. I took the tetanus shot but I'm growing increasingly paranoid. It's been almost 2 hours since that bite. I've checked on Google in some cases the wound is so tiny you need a magnifying glass to see it. This guy didn't even ask me where I was bitten, if I was bitten, if I bled, as soon as he heard cat bite he'd started writing. I don't know if I should trust him, I'm kind of a paranoid person. I live in a small town so there's no private hospitals here, there's private clinics but they don't open till 5 pm. I don't know, what do I do?"

In India, I notice that a lot of people depend on religion to ease their anxieties around these issues. For a lot of people, there is no certainty around income, there is no accessibility to health care. This creates massive anxieties. People turn to religion as a way to cope with these anxieties.

You can also contrast Western Europe, which is not very religious, with the USA, which, in comparison, is highly religious. Most countries in Western Europe have a reasonable social security program and healthcare for all. The US, on the other hand, has highly conditional social security and very low healthcare access and affordability. I am not arguing that the US also has great technology in healthcare but that accessibility is low because of issues and expenses of health insurance. Similarly, social security is available in the US but is difficult, and often humiliating, to access. This creates huge anxieties around food, shelter and healthcare. Interestingly, America is a much more religious society than Western Europe. Is this a coincidence?

I am also not arguing that there are no outliers. That is, there are a lot of rich people who have access to healthcare who are very religious. Similarly, there might be poor atheists. These outliers can be explained by the fact that everyone's personal journey is different and various types of life events might result in different views on religion.

What do y'all think? Is this a reasonable view?

Edit: And if Modi realises this, he will ensure that we will never have any form of social security or healthcare."

Wanted to discuss the situation regarding the extension today, it was a basic need for a country like ours for sure, just imagine if community spread starts in India it will dwarf the problems the whole world is looking at now. We see teasers of this even today in Surat etc., but they are just sparks and it will be a storm if it spreads.

Having said that one thing I do feel we are neglecting is the economical part, which might lead to bigger problems than the flu itself. Even with the lockdown lifted labor that is gone won’t be instantly back, in fact I expect labor still in place will head for their homes, this will be just the 1st step. We are unable to immediately revive even our essential manufacturing facilities and this delay will lead to shortages increasing panic across the country. This leads to a self-feeding issue i.e. the problems compounding due to not stopping a small problem leading to bigger and bigger ones. I am in Punjab, from my window I can see the fields ripe for harvest, it was to be ramping up last week with full flow tomorrow, it is looking very unlikely right now because of the lack of labor. After the lifting of lockdown if it takes weeks upon weeks to get back to production, the shortages will become more and more dire and in the following months we will see the fire that the tiny sparks in Surat, Mumbai etc. are trying to show bringing us face to face with fate in an abyss.

The main reason for writing this isn’t to point out our bad future or blame someone it is to suggest some basic resources we haven’t utilized till now, some ideas. Starting from the labor or our poorer brethren heading back, it is because they feel outsiders in the place they are, unable to receive help or the unknown scaring them for the future, we solve this we start our work on solving our non-flu problems. Right now, at a time of limited resources we are using the bare minimums to seek out the needy (Police delivering food), we need to reverse this the needy need to come to the source (Pyasa Kuey pe aye, Kua pyase ke pass nai), of course that is basically breaking the lockdown so what we need is something very accessible that wont lead to a breaking of curfew yet accessible enough for the needy to access. The two things I can think of are police stations and post offices, every neighborhood in our country has one of these nearby. We should implement distribution of resources to the needy by them approaching the nearest one and collecting the resource, this can be further closed down to the needy of station “32” area, “row 1” can send 1 person from 8 to 830 and “row 2” from 9 to 930 so on. If some needy are left they use the phone numbers and the resources are delivered by night. This can also work for the harvest we need the labor willing to work to assemble at the local station maintaining social distance at a specific hour and the ones who need labor can sign them up or even not have a face to face have the labor register and the hirer registering at different times and the nearest ones matching are informed. This can be implemented in a manner which minimizes the number of people outside at the same time, put money into hands needing them, if somebody is not hired then the info is already there and we utilize MNREGA and make sure everyone who needs work has income.

We need to utilize the vast call center resources that our country has, the call centers should be hired for a limited time by the government to answer calls and make calls so every citizen is in touch and knowledgeable about their duties and fulfillment of their needs, this has 3 benefits, calling can be done from home, phones have a very deep reach into the interior needy areas, income start for the callers. This should be done against a basic citizen database so info can added next to every name, if they are good it says good, if the have a need the need is mentioned, then by level of severity the issues are handled by the required organization.

Running out of room so lastly, the biggest resource we are not utilizing is our citizens at home, they can be put to use in many ways, Ill give one example. Our medical sector is facing a huge need of PPE equipment, if you look at what this equipment it is something that can be made at home with resources we already have (Standards might not be same but something is more than nothing.) The lack of visors for example, how many of us have helmets at home simply remove the glass at front attach elastic and we have one visor ready, if the government puts out a request we as a community can respond to what we can and what we make can be collected from houses and reach where needed. We have so many professions essential sitting at home, today Punjab got 1000 tests, that is a bit less than the testing required, we need every chemist in the country to have the information needed to make the test if they can prepare it they do and government can collect. 

These ideas might be the worst you have heard but what I am trying to get to is in a stereotype Indians are portrayed as IT nerds, call center land or brainy we need to be utilizing these for basic ideas. Only lockdown wont save us. I would ask you try reach to whoever you can to try and spread the ideas. I will try and get my idea to someone in authority, if you want please write your solutions and post on Facebook twitter or whatever you have, I am tired of reading our issues everyday in newspapers hopefully in a few days newspapers will be carrying information that can be utilized to solve a problem we are facing.

We can do that or do nothing, “May the Planet heal and life thrive”

Untill he chooses a profession for himself, why not show him what careers and this world is like  in some kind of Vanity van or exploring bus?

Parental Supervision - Once the kid returns back to home from the school he faces his parents. A lot of parents are not trained to deal with kids. Still these parents advice them, scold, influence and in worst cases, abuse and beat the children. What is the need for a parental supervision after a minimum age like 10?

Colleges - A college for medical science or civil/ mechanical engineering might be necessary. But for computer engineering, what's the need for making a person attend lectures on topic he has already learnt well from Udemy and make him waste 3 years for a course in college that he can cover in just 1.5 years by himself?

Jobs - I have felt a lot of people are frustrated with their jobs. The frustrations can be can be reduced if we give them atleast a 10 day vacation to a peaceful place after every 90 days. Makes it 40 days in a year. Government Jobs have 30. Private jobs give lesser than that. In India, this is even more important as traffic and noise is too much in the cities and people crave for a heaven escape after every few weeks or months. 

Arranged Marriage - Its often difficult for those in a love marriage to keep the love intact for upto 50 years. Imagine how scary it would be for those in an arranged marriage to live together for even 10 years.

Stigma against Hookup Culture - Nations like India are famous for tinder bios like ""Not here for hookups"". Even a lot of parents of girls are against sex before marriage, compelling these girls to meet their boyfriends in secrecy. I don't know why parents do this but I have heard it is done to increase the value and sanctity of their daughter for the groom who comes as the highest bidder with the highest paying job.

Craze for Luxury Goods - Sonam Wangchuk in a video described how he prefers to wear simple clothes. The logic is that the more clothes we buy, the more smoke is released into the air from the factory. The same idea can be applied in luxury food and many other things."

I've heard about the poor water quality, Delhi belly (caution against street food), beggars, so HOT, not to walk outside at night, scammers on the street, dirty, filled with pollution, etc. but I want to know if there is any truth to any of this and what I can do to have a great experience.
3. What cities (and sights) would you most recommend for a first-timer in India if I were to travel there for 7-10 days? Where can I find the busiest and most chaotic streets in India (as this fascinates me, as in the USA the roads are very organized). What kind of budget would I need for 7-10 days?
4. Also just out of curiosity, what stereotypes of India or Indian people would you wish to disappear as they are not true?
5. What else can I do to best prepare for a trip to India?

Any information, suggestions, tips, or advice would be greatly appreciated!"

The problem here is that we need to reach to the class that has no technology to ask for help. I need suggestions for it.

Also, we need volunteers with vehicles who have e-passes to go out during this period for this to function at a big level.

[Advocate Rohit Bras de Sa files letter petition before HC on account of scarcity of essential commodities & lack of machanism to provide basic food supply to vulnerable wage workers, says people of Goa are struggling to find even basic goods to sustain themselves in curfew days](https://twitter.com/prudentgoa/status/1243101931666468869)

If you want to lend your support on Twitter, retweet the following tweet en mass. It's from Zoe, a foreign national, who's been trying to get international media's attention on the issue: 

[Brits & foreigners stranded in Goa, India. The state has closed all shops for past three days. Residents & tourists have not been able to buy any essentials, there has been police brutality, videoed beatings. People already have no access to water and are starving.](https://twitter.com/Diggidywiggidy/status/1243028124192800768)

The study is being conducted under the supervision of my professor. We are exploring the thought processes of our community during these troubled times. It’s very important to understand how Indians in different phases of their lives are perceiving the pandemic, and drawing a comparison of this sort would help us in understanding how psychologists could help each of the age groups to cope with uncertainty better.

#####Precautions for prevention of Corona Virus
^Currently ^there ^is ^no ^vaccine ^available ^to ^protect ^against ^human ^corona ^virus ^but ^we ^can ^reduce ^the ^transmission ^of ^virus ^by ^taking ^following ^precautions:

* Do
 * Wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub
 * Cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue or flexed elbow when you cough or sneeze
 * Avoid close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell
 * Stay home and self-isolate from others in the household if you feel unwell
* Don't
 * Touch your eyes, nose, or mouth if your hands are not clean

#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)
^If ^you’re ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^that’s ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you’ve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.

^It’s ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.

1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.

2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (and only after you’ve called first) — wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.

3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven’t just washed them.

4. **DISINFECTING**: Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.

5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you’re touching anything that might carry the patient’s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.

Amidst the pandemic scenes, I lost my campus placement. I was not interested in it anyway as I hated the course I took with all my heart(Computer Science). I took it as I didn't have much knowledge about ny future after higher secondaries and everyone said taking computer science would land me a job.

I regret this decision more than anything in my life.

I find many thing interesting, like designing stuffs, may it be posters, cars or anything. My parents and friends always used to say I have an artistic mind. I draw a lot too, good pictures also.

Then I got into photography, I take a lot of photos and still do. Have won 2-3 local photography contests. But never invested in it because I never got time to do so.

Also I never knew how to get into this photography field? I don't know anything else than taking photos and posting them on social media for meaningless likes.

By photography I mean wildlife, landscape, etc. I wish to work for any established companies as their photographer. I really wont care about the salary very much as atleast I would love what I'm doing. The thought of sitting infront if a computer just drives me crazy everyday.

I need help and advice. Do I need to complete degrees in photography to get into the field? Please help me in anyway you can.

TL;DR: Good student, joined Btech, hates life, loves photography, need advice for photography career."

We are building Future of credit - Financial inclusion to everyone

We are searching for kickass name & which should not related to credit, it should be trendy, easy to  spell for every one country agnostic, we are creating a new platform where it takes milli seconds to  apply loan by  borrower with or without financial history Lenders able to underwrite & disburse the loan in seconds, with out human intervention. We are also changing the entire credit process  & using smart phone alternative credit data. We are using AI, ML, quantum computing in big time you’re interested in changing the future of credit.

3 billion humans cannot access basic credit services and fewer than 9% of citizens in developing economies have ever taken a loan from a financial institution.

In many economies, generations of people are governed by a dark underworld of illegal lending  a pseudo-economy ran by gangsters and fraudsters. For these 3 billion people, the idea of accessing enough credit to buy a home or start a business is a pipe dream. 

In countries rich and poor, access to credit is a fundamental cornerstone of social mobility. No matter your age, gender, language or nation, credit is the key driving force to boosting prosperity. From a newlywed couple looking to settle down and buy their first home, to an aspiring entrepreneur looking to start a small business, virtually every human on the planet depends on credit. It is the gateway to financial inclusion and ultimately financial freedom.

I recently had an argument with my Mom, about the role of muslims in the recent covid 19 spread in India. I said I'm not disagreeing that certain groups of the muslim community are solely responsible for a massive spike in infections, but the tone that you are implying means that you had a problem with muslims long before this covid infection started.

Upon hearing this, she went full defensive mode, saying muslims are responsible for all the wars with India and they are responsible for every atrocity in India. I asked how many muslims have you spoken to in your life ?  She said she knows about Pakistan and the wars and that is enough. She said they are ""abishwas jati""

Our argument heated up and now I'm here asking what do I do to change her opinion that all muslims aren't ""Pakistani"" and aren't out to destroy the world. Media doesn't portray muslim in good light and it has led to years of indoctrination with older people who have no other contact other than media. But I am not saying I am apologising for muslims. I am an atheist and consider all religions to be irrelevant, islam to be the most if I had to draw a priority chart.

&#x200B;

EDIT:  One more point, To make matters worse, when Italy was #1 in covid infections, I found she was googling, ""how many muslims are there in Italy"". It was both hilarious and sad that she drew causality vs correlation, though that argument would have failed as well as Italy is not a muslim majority country."

TL;DR, India lacks systematic registration of deaths even in the absence of the current pandemic. It would be extremely optimistic to assume that the deceased numbers being reported are comprehensive and cover all deaths due to covid-19. If anything, the real number of deaths can only expected to be higher.

  
There have been several claims recently that the number of deaths are lower in India than other nations and this is being seen as an indicator of India's success in controlling the fatality due to the pandemic. In a recent discussion with a friend, a medical professional, while we both agreed that more testing was needed, a question came up whether or not the number of deaths depicts the real picture on the ground. From my point of view, I was not too sure whether in India all deaths were actually being registered in a normal scenario. My friend was however convinced that all births and deaths were always registered, and hence there is no doubt that India is seeing a lower mortality rate as we are counting the number of positive cases and resulting deaths. Additional deaths resulting from untested cases would still have caused a spike in total deaths as all deaths and causes of deaths are normally always reported.

Today, I was trying to find official population statistics regarding the number of births and deaths in India. These numbers are usually provided by the census-related offices of a country. For India, it seems that the latest reported data from the country wide Civil Registration System (CRS) regarding number of births and deaths is from 2017 (annual report at [http://crsorgi.gov.in/annual-report.html](http://crsorgi.gov.in/annual-report.html)).

I was surprised to know that (refer: Table 5 on page 61 of the annual report):

1. In 2017 the overall level of death registration in India was around 80% (i.e. 8 out of 10 deaths are actually reported).
2. State-wise, the level of registration was only around 40% in some of the high population states like UP and Bihar. This means, 6 out of 10 deaths are not even officially registered! This is the official data from 2017, and it has nothing to do with current pandemic.

Moreover, even for the registered deaths, the quality of data regarding the actual cause of death is extremely poor. The ""cause of death"" was identified in less than 20% of the cases (Source article: [https://theprint.in/opinion/indian-health-data-will-miss-recording-many-covid-and-lockdown-deaths/403432/](https://theprint.in/opinion/indian-health-data-will-miss-recording-many-covid-and-lockdown-deaths/403432/))

Given these statistics, it would be extremely optimistic for anyone to assume that the numbers being reported are comprehensive and cover all deaths due to covid-19. If anything, **the real number of deaths can only expected to be higher**. 

These are challenging times, and each one of us has the responsibility to be vigilant so as not to spread misinformation and false claims just to feel a little good about ourselves. We need to test more and more people (as most other countries have been doing) and adopt a transparent reporting mechanism of the numbers (tested/positive/recovered/dead). It is clear that in the case of India, we also need massive improvements and transparency in systematic and quality registration and reporting of the births and deaths."

So what is the Bechdel test?

The Bechdel test has three simple, unambiguous criterias:

* A film has to have at least two (named) women characters in it.

* These women characters at some point of the movie talk to each other.

* They talk about something other than men.

The test has it's inspiration (seemingly) in an 1929 essay by Virginia Woolf.

One of the larger samples tested in 2019 resulted in very few Hindi movies actually passing the same.

https://thelogicalindian.com/story-feed/awareness/bollywood-hindi-cinema-bechdel-test

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6Amqk0gSE

I'm not even sure how regional cinema fares in this.

Television all across the country seems like it will fail the same miserably.

While the test has no assurance about the *quality* of female representation in the said movie \ work of fiction - one small incentive is, **it's observed that movies who do meet the criteria are known to perform better financially, than those who don't.**
