#####Precautions for prevention of Corona Virus
^Currently ^there ^is ^no ^vaccine ^available ^to ^protect ^against ^human ^corona ^virus ^but ^we ^can ^reduce ^the ^transmission ^of ^virus ^by ^taking ^following ^precautions:

* Do
 * Wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub
 * Cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue or flexed elbow when you cough or sneeze
 * Avoid close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell
 * Stay home and self-isolate from others in the household if you feel unwell
* Don't
 * Touch your eyes, nose, or mouth if your hands are not clean

#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)
^If ^you’re ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^that’s ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you’ve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.

^It’s ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.

1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.

2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (and only after you’ve called first) — wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.

3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven’t just washed them.

4. **DISINFECTING**: Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.

5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you’re touching anything that might carry the patient’s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.

First, its in the interest of consumer's safety as they don't have to step out of their house (and thus risk getting COVID). Second, its in the interest of e-commerce vendors as their rozi-roti (income stream) will get started at least. Third, its in the interest of entire nation too as disease transmission will slow down if people start ordering only from their homes.

The government seriously can't think of infrastructure projects or organic growth projects to provide that within the country?

Can't help but compare this to slavery, except the fact that it's voluntary instead of having workers shipped like export by the thousands. 

This also shows a lack of pride in the Indian race. Now of course Indian government officials certainly aren't the type of people to care about that. But I compare this to other historical times people immigrate to other countries. Japan for instance was not allowing workers to go to Hawaii for the longest time due to the fact that they didn't want to have the Japanese race associated with working cheap labor in sugar plantations.

For only 10 minutes. When I came back  to my housing complex gate, the guard interjected: ""Sir!"" He was  holding one of those non-contact thermometers. Obviously this was  initiated by the housing society itself.  First of all, no one has to be  told to stop at the gate of their residence to be tested. Secondly,  having high fever is not a specific indicator of covid.

Has anybody had this initiated in their housing complex during this pandemic? Whether yes or no, how do you feel about ~~this bullshit~~ it?

Edit: I was not raised in India and I say this because for me, it's more a matter of how things are conducted, because there are cultural differences. I've been following the lockdown rules to a T. The fact that a guard is taking my temperature is not right. It's not his job. I'm a resident here. I have a thermometer at home.

I consulted doctors, who also said its the allergy. I read its the overactive immune system which responds to foreign objects.

Once corona patients are admitted to hospitals, no communication is received till the patient dies or recovers.

If the patient dies, he may not even get reason as covid 19 in his death certificate since state government are trying to suppress deaths. But whole of his family is forcefully taken into quarantine centre. Their house is locked and left unguarded. Many robberies are taking place due to this.

If relatives happen to become corona positive, they will be admitted to hospitals and same process as above will repeat.

Government does not have a clear plan on what to do with corona dead bodies. If they hand over it to relative, they are unable to carry the patients to their home or near by funeral centres due to corona stigmas.

If there is no nearby funeral centre, even hospital would not want to take risk of taking care of cremation. Hospital also would not want to use those dead bodies for lab.

If the family recovers from corona, they are not allowed back to the village/society, even though, they are showing certificate of recovery from the hospital. They are forced to go in hiding.

Now, even in lock down period, cases doubling up every 9 days, India will soon have few lakhs cases.

The mismanagement will cost more life than the corona itself.

What is your suggestion to improve the situation."

The amount people are willing to go through for someone they've only ever seen on TV is almost unreal, and the way many are genuinely following the lockdown in most cities is incredible.

Of course, some of it has been overshadowed by overt minority bashing, occasionally [daft recommendations](https://theprint.in/india/modi-govt-wants-states-to-start-producing-herbal-remedy-for-covid-19-immunity-sends-recipe/408931/) and foolish theatrics of *thaali peeto.* But that has been a travesty since 2014, some good with a generous smattering of [foolish](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/demonetisation-caused-3-percentage-point-decline-jobs-economic-activity/story/383338.html).

He has Leukemia ( diagnosed in 2016) and  **Bronchitis** and he's been so paranoid about the whole coronavirus precautions, I think something has gone wrong with him I think he needs professional help.

&#x200B;

* He wears a mask almost all the time Inside the house
* Our house is on the 4th floor and opens from both sides. IDK how but he thinks the air will bring in particles of coronavirus so we've been living with closed doors and very poor ventilation for the past 1 month.
* We also own the roof rights but since he is afraid of the Air, he doesn't allow anyone to go there and for breathing fresh air. he rarely stands at the balcony.
* He doesn't want anybody to use AC in the house because of...( pretty obv by now)
* Nobody comes in or goes out of the house. The last time we went for a grocery run was like a month ago. We've been fueled by just that. 2 times daal roti a day, almost every day. Fruits sometimes. He thinks anyone can bring the virus inside the house. Ration will probably run out in a week I have no idea what we're gonna do. The last time I ate a green vegetable was also a month ago. He Doesn't allow us to buy vegetables either from the street hawkers or online marts.
* Just when the lockdown started, our water purifier broke down ( eff you Kent ) . for the first few days, we were drinking tap water by boiling it and then cooling it rapidly. Then he got paranoid that it's affecting his kidney so we somehow managed to bring in a few crates of bisleri 1l bottle. They'll run out soon.
* Someone told him not to put the phone on the ear while talking so now we all talk on speakers or earphones.
* He has had a total of 15 or 16 hours of sleep in the last 7 days. Takes a sleeping pill but it only affects him for 2 hours. ( its a 5mg). Too scared to take any more than that. Hasn't had any fresh air for the past month.
* Has constant headaches and migraines.

Long story short,  he is quite bad and literally on the border. He cries a lot these days and it breaks my heart to see him like this.

So here's the thing. He just wants to go back to the family house in UP ( Moradabad ). He's been having a guilt trip of not leaving the city in time and I don't know how to get us(family of 4) there. Is there a way I can leave border into UP without being stopped. \[ ***he also thinks that as soon as we try to go for the border, they will lock us up in quarantine wards \]***.

&#x200B;

I'm not looking for medical help. Trust me, I've tried, Counselors, Psychiatrists , NIHMANS Helpline. All of it. Nothing worked and I doubt anything will. It's just the last hope. To go back to Moradabad for some reason. If this goes on, He'll either Die by the end or either I'll commit suicide because you can't possibly begin to think how difficult it is here. I just need a way to cross the border somehow without being denied or being put into quarantine.

What should we do?I'm not going to name my friend for the sake of privacy so let's call her Arushi. Arushi was teaching at The Newtown School, Kolkata for the past one year, and she had given her resignation in the end of the month of February, and by contract she was meant to serve a notice period of 2 months that was to end on 29th of April. The school closed off temporarily due to the coronavirus lockdown eventually, as every other school did. On the 17th of April, she sent a mail to the school HR asking for instructions on how to go about the exit procedure. To which, the HR replied that the school no longer requires her services after the 15th of April (which was a date **before** she even sent her query letter) and that her notice period is being waived off. This was done without **any** prior notice at all and even though she was doing her duties completely sincerely.

Arushi, then, mailed to the principal and the school's chairman saying that she was serving her duties as she had been asked and also requesting to not end her term during this time of a global pandemic where she will be severely affected by a such a sudden stop in payment. To which the school's HR replied in complete negligence and only highlighted that how contractually, the school has complete rights to waive off the notice period of an employee and they're doing it to save resources. This is from a school that forces teachers to sales pitch parents during PTMs to buy iPads from the school so that it ""aids their children in education"" and also pays incentives to the teachers for every new student admission referrals they could make. (this is just to mention some of the evidences that the so called school is just a huge business playground and would actually have no problem continuing to pay her). This completely done on the grounds that she was a junior employee who did not cut any corners and seemed too credulous to be easily laid out of the organization. They are't doing the same to any other employee(s), in question.

Arushi is thoroughly broken mentally because she had been a dedicated employee of the institution for her entire term and had always stepped out of her obligations so as to help her colleagues and the institution in every way, and the school paid her commitment back in the means of waiving her off without any prior notice, let alone the fact that the term end date (15th Apr) was one that was days BEFORE the date of the letter received (18th Apr). The school also chose to do this in the time of such a global crisis where the government has continually requested institutions and organizations to not lay off employees for the sake of the employees' families. We really don't know what to do or who to talk to about this and we need help. What can possibly be done about this? What should we do? Whom should we try to reach or talk to? Please comment any suggestion that you may have.

Almost all govt dept. agencies have announced donation of one-day/one-week/one-month salary for relief. Don't worry participation is ""Voluntary"" though.

arguing with people blatantly using the  in  argument or the we have k tests now argument The only reason we arent under a mountain of dead bodies right now is because of the virus being comparitively less virulent in India because of whatever reason The lockdown has helped but as I said we arent testing enough at all I get that we do not have the necessary resources but denying community transmission for the th time and spinning the narrative doesnt change the facts', 'The number of tests per day doesnt seem to have a direct correlation to the number of new cases per day Either we are over testing or testing the wrong crowd', 'I dont buy ICMR is the only institute working with govt on coronavirus I constantly feel its just an image to communicate from Let the scientists in ICMR do their job why pester them and label them as problem', 'It isnt less virulent by any standardsPeople just arent reporting it because of our cultural history that its totally cool and macho to not ask for medical help', 'This idea that we can test enough people is a myth How to select the people to test  Any criteria selected would be prone to missing positive cases not fitting the criteria Can we test everybody ie evert single person  The answer is obvious If we test a person and he is negative today can he become positive tomorrow  The answer again is obviousPCR tests can yield false negatives admittedly rarely but even a  error is a huge number Please read this  httpswwwsciencedailycomreleaseshtmNo virus can be eliminated without the perfect drug Smallpox took years even with a vaccine polio is still not eradicated This is a disease affecting the richer and more well off Countries which have never seen a pandemic are experiencing it Large scale outbreaks are expected to be in poorer countries This is the reason for the panic If Covid was extremely virulent or deadly the death and spread cant be stopped Despite the limited knowledge and excess ignorance in the general populace if we are not seeing enormous numbers we can proceed admittedly with caution but full speed ahead', 'If it isnt a less virulent strain then we have a better immune response against Covid which is plausible because of a plethora of reasons Also theres a high possibility of the strain in india and South Asia being a less virulent type so idk where you got your info from but please at least update yourself before stating something Nothing is confirmed as of now but ongoing studies indicate that there are a number of mutations of the virus already and it has been so for quite some timeIt has nothing to do with culture lmao what are you even saying You cant hide a death or SARI by being macho If you dont report it then you die and unless its WB youll know the numbers We have a relatively small death count despite having a very small testing pool Lower testing as I said can downplay the spread of the virus but it cant hide the number of dead people and so far the mortality rate in india has been far better than any other country despite having over k people as positive I would like to hear your reasoning for this why do we have so few deaths  Despite being in a lockdown we have k cases if the situation was identical to the US we would have over k dead by now infact probably way more than that because the rate would increase exponentially not linearly', 'Emm heard of this thing called pool testing Not fool proof but a good shot at getting some good picture about whats going on and where', 'Its simple We arent testing enough throughout India and people are not reporting the cases either because of the filth in government hospitals or because of their macho Mughe kuch nahi hota delusion of grandeurThe cases of coronavirus are always high in places where they test moreSame with deaths People are automatically ruled out from testing because theyre dead long before they even managed to go to the hospital Hospitals and ambulances are flat out refusing their patients and are saying that The patient wasnt worthy enough to be carried to the hospitalThe massive as fuck difference in states should be obvious to anyone and everyone The reason why Maharashtra has the most cases in India than any other state is simply because theyre doing their due diligence Its more than what I can say for West Bengal UP MP and all other states apparentlyKerela also did a good job of managing this shit by atleast opening up testing boothsThe virus mutates extremely fast and the mutagens of the virus are also extremely unstable so basically its safe to say that the virus can easily morph into the more deadlier strains which other countries which have a higher mortality rate than oursOur central government and the ICMR is blatantly lying as they always do I mean not even  months ago they literally sold out nearly  million smoking citizens of their by depriving them of better alternatives to traditional cigarettes by banning ecigarettes completely The bill was so fucking rushed that they only banned the trading aspect of it and not the using aspect of it and are now illegally confiscating ecigarettes from their citizensEveryone including our Prime Minister and the President of India were complicit in willfully killing their citizens so from that standpoint it isnt so far fetched is to assuming that they wont stop the lying anytime soon for lining their own pocketsAnother huge cunt is Nirmala Sitharaman A trade minister should have no fucking interest in health policies but apparently she was at the forefront of this issue Its apparent that she had a vested interest in this topic and had a clear bias for it which is literally illegal in most democracies and those politicians are vulnerable to impeachmentEven the supreme court which is the apex court of our so called Democratic Country has denied to hear the plea of their fellow citizens who just want to use a much safer alternative to the traditional cigarettesI mean their own citizens are literally fucking WALKING from one state to another just to fucking get home and are dying on the streets like dogs either because of starvation or exhaustion and the fucking Prime Minister Narendra Modi and our President Ram Nath Kovind more like covid couldnt fucking care lessThen theres the issue of fake news and Islamophobia Arnab fucking Goswami who was a member of the Editors Guild of India has fucking resigned because of all the blatant toxic whoreshit lies which he has spewed even during a global pandemic crisisNow theres the ecommerce ban scandal Like seriously what in the actual fuck is wrong with these people Sometimes it feels like they just want everyone to fucking dieThe PMCARES fund apparently isnt audited by government auditors so theres thatDespite electoral bonds being introduced no political party  in India notably the BJP whos main campaign was to fucking end corruption but ended up being the fucking the most cancerous party ever known to mankind hasnt shelled out even a single fucking rupee from their warchest or their bankOh did I mention spraying people with fucking bleach and how it is a fucking health hazard Did I also mention that ICMR has TO THIS FUCKING DATE refused to acknowledge that the community transmission phase hasnt started yet and how they openly bribed the WHO to take sides with themThe best part of all this whoreshit is that journalists and doctors are arrested on sedition charges for speaking up about the truth but the news channels are lying through their swollen up asshole of a mouth about the Islamophobic agendas of the BJP ruled central governmentSo now after all this whoreshit can you seriously tell me with a straight fucking face that the BJP ruled central government isnt lying about it if they can repeatedly lie about all the above mentioned issues and if they can fucking throw their citizens under the bus and willfully kill them without even loosing a second of their sleepSeriously get a grip over yourself', 'ICMR guidelines specify a maximum of  samples as pool so even x of our current numbers of tests is still too smallFalse negatives are at A paper httpswwwmedrxivorgcontentv postulates a maximum of  but thats not the pointThere is no way to prevent silent transmission Every time any person steps out the risk exists that he can be infected Unless we can ensure extreme biosafety levels in day to day life infection will exist Assuming we can test pool of  to test all of india you need still to conduct about  crore tests with our population to cover everyone', 'You really need to get a grip over reality lmao The number of deaths reported is approximately correct unlike the number of infected Stop mentioning conjecture lolI asked for a reason and you just blabbered on about not testing enough lol which has nothing to do with deaths All SARI deaths are accounted for So yeah Mr big brain iq  go ahead and maybe accept the fact that you were wrong The entire world knows we arent testing enough but dont be under the false impression that this changes the mortality rate at all If anything more testing would have reduced the mortality rate instead of increasing it because the numerator wouldnt

the initial days werent all corona ve cases identified by travel history to Italy or travel history to China etc  So similarly I see nothing wrong in listing the source as Tablighi Jamat for many cases Better than single source If Im not mistaken a gurudwara function was also responsible as being a superspreader you can search and add that to your little list But this was localised to Punjab

Copied this comment to highlight my point. 

""Only from the economic effects. There are less old people and way less people with severe health conditions (who in our rich western nations are only alive because of the health service anyway). 65% of India's population is under 35 - they are at no risk at all from CV19. The median age is 26.8 compared to the USA 38.2. Tuberculosis kills 220,000 people every year in India and that is a disease that already has a vaccine. So far the country is in lockdown for a massive total of 680 CV19 deaths.

It is absolutely crazy that these countries are attempting a 'lockdown' strategy, when 3,000 children die from starvation every day in India. It's completely pointless, the extra mortality from CV19 will only be a blip for India, the mortality from the extra starvation deaths alone, let alone the ensuing economic consequences, will be way, way worse."" - Ilovewillsface



I think they got enough time. This virus is not as dangerous as they say it is and it also hasn't caused much damage. More people die from accidents, other health issues. I think India is strong and immune to face this virus without lockdown. Why can't we just move on and live with it? I think we're overreacting and unnecessarily damaging economy and it's affecting healthy non infected people as they're facing job loss, hunger, recession and depression, & suicides. 

It looks like Government is not in the mood to remove lockdown till next year. How much time does Government need before it can go on attack mode against covid."

These trends were on top of the list, surpassing important national events!

Today, I stumbled upon a Twitter profile of a Big Boss contestant who released a music video a couple of days ago. He seems to have a ton of followers who absolutely adore him and do whatever that is asked. Like, Share, Subscribe, view, endorse, defend and what not. I watched the music video myself and honestly, I don't have anything good to say about it. It remixed (and ruined) an old Bollywood classic song. All that stood out in it where the looks of the two leads.

**Not revealing name or link since it might be against r/india policy**

I spent some time looking at these fan profiles and it looks like they their life's only mission is to promote him, his music and whatever he does.

Who are these people and what motivates them to do this? It does not look like it is PR campaign since some profiles appear genuine.

I see some posts where he asks them to *show him some love* and they appear do so no questions asked. Its not just limited to this guy, I'm sure there are many.

I can understand if the actor/actress is talented and the work is genuinely good and stands out; in such cases there is value in sharing such posts but the work coming from these ""celebs"" is mediocre and honestly not worthy of any attention."

Love your country and culture.

So, to the matter I would like your opinion. 

Recently I finished my latest project. It's an urban fantasy/thriller where a group of young people discover they have powers of gods and creatures from various ancient mythologies. The major problem I found while writing this, was naming the characters, so for most of them, I named them with something that could reference the god they had the powers of.

For exemple, there's Fiona, who has the powers of a shapeshifting witch. Fiona being a common name for a white witch in Ireland. Also Diana, who has the powers of the goddess Artemis, goddess of the moon. For the one with the powers of Zeus, I named Edison after Thomas Edison who had a great deal of influence in revolutionazing electricity.

But the one I struggled the most to name was the antagonist, who has the powers of Apollo. Until someday I mentioned it to a friend of mine and she told me to name him Ravi, a common Indian name that means ""The Sun"". I loved the idea, and I made him have Indian ancestry. His ethnicity wasn't a big part of his character, just some background for him. Nothing wrong with that, right? Or so I thought. It wasn't until I finished it that I became aware of the problem.

A major part of Ravi's early plot, is his job. It's how he meets some important people, it's how he comes to despise the main character. I had written this part before naming him and giving him the Indian ancestry. He works at a telemarketing company. See the big stereotype now? This was never intended.

So now I come to think of it, is this racist/xenophobic? Should I change his name and ancestry or maybe even try to rewritte the plot with him working a different job? What do you guys think?"

So I graduated in 2017 doing my BSc in CS, Phy, and Math from a tier two city. I got a job offer from a mass recruiter but I declined it due to not matching my personal ambitions and generally because I wasn't too enthused about my job prospects with them.

I was first very much into doing my MS in a college with good options and in a field that I felt was challenging and interesting to me. But before I could really do a deep dive and narrowed down the fields, I got to know that it's a high risk taking a loan for myself when my family is reeling in them worth 50+lakhs due to a new house construction.

I know I could have gotten a loan for myself kissing my family and the problems goodbye but somehow it didn't agree with me, so in short I decided to not pursue my MS degree.

I took a part-time job working from home with shit pay but I still put up with it and focused on the few positives, it being that I was able to start my own savings and pay for my own expenses. I left the part-time job last month because my payments got fucked by the guy I was working under (he used it on himself) and decided to become self-employed working in a similar field but with pay which is not fixed and depends on the availability of work and how many hours I put into it.

The WFH job which I'm currently doing is in such a field that I'm not particularly interested in nor have hopes of it sustaining future market fluctuations. But due to a lack of options, it seems like a 'something's-better-than-nothing' situation for me.

 So this leads to present day, writing this post and trying to figure out how the fuck am I supposed to move ahead. For reference, I'm only 24 and I know I have a life ahead of me, but it seems like all my doors are closing one by one if I don't take action for the future I want for myself, one with financial security enough to puruse my own hobbies and interests freely. Because I know in reality it's not that simple to get the best of both worlds.

Any further clarifications will be provided so please do ask me, but thank you for reading this. Any help or advice is truly appreciated. Have a good day."

I graduated in 2018 had been in a MNC since then till around November 2019.At that time i was quite happy to leave thinking i would prepare for MS in US and got busy with applications and stuff.Jan 2020 I lost my Nana,It hit me really hard as this was the first time I lost someone who was so close to me and I was very devastated the whole month(i still miss him though).After overcoming it came february the decisions from unis had been coming and I was kind of enjoying and rejoicing every moment of freedom with my family(as i had a strict plan for masters wasn't looking out much for jobs/internships)as well as learning and upskilling myself.Now comes March this pandemic causes my plan to go haywire and even the situation abroad is worse.So seeing all these stuff and many unis turning to online option which i really don't wanna consider I started getting anxious and nervous as now there has been a lot of gap in my resume.Additionally going abroad amidst such economic and health crisis seems kinda risky.Now I am feeling kind of lost,depressed and overthinking has become an everyday thing although i have started applying on LinkedIn which made me realize how fking hard is it to bag a job outside(especially software sector) and since i am not earning since the past 6-7 months it has made me desperate to earn some bucks even though he job is in a non IT sector.Hope I get through this.Any advices and help would be appreciated.

Thanks and Stay safe everyone."

I live in an apartment so we have a place to dispose of them and the rest gets taken care of. But I have noticed that some people still only have trash cans and they throw the garbage in it directly and that creates a disgusting and smelly trash can. Once we had new residents in our community and they used to throw the plastic bags out on the streets until someone taught them that there was a specific location designed for garbage disposal. Yet, still many people who have their own houses just throw the garbage on the streets. I'm glad though that I don't have to go to those disgusting dumping sites to throw the garbage. That's what we had to do when we lived on rent. 

The plastic cans deteriorate very quickly no matter how much you take care of them and the steel ones (of an appropriate size) are quite expensive. Technology has advanced so much but we still don't have affordable solutions to these issues."

Later it was found that the fake tweet is indeed real and was tweeted by himGoing to be a long story but worth the drama (i guess) if you are bored. 

TLDR: Richa Chadha shared an old tweet picture of a BJP IT cell worker which says that his daily work is spreading propaganda on twitter. The IT cell employee claims it as a fake tweet and threatens to file a defamation case. But, after a few hours, Twitter users prove that the tweet was indeed real. Instead of accepting his mistake, he is now trying to mud-sling those people by creating morphed tweets.

So, Richa Chadha and few others [shared](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EWW4A-aUYAE5iuF.jpg) a picture of Rishi Bagree's tweet on July 10th 2016. The tweet says 

""Dear @AmitShah 
We spend almost 5-6 hrs/daily defending BJP
Ignoring our Family
Ignoring our health

& now a BJP min is branding us as TROLL""

A little background regarding the tweet, on July 8th 2016, Maneka Gandhi (then BJP minister) [approached IT Ministry to deal with abusive trolls](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/maneka-gandhi-social-media-bullies-beware-maneka-gandhi-war-on-trolls-328121-2016-07-08). It is [said](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cm-0gNCXYAEG5Tx.jpg) that she has given a list of abusive twitter (and FB) users to twitter India (and FB India) and asked them to block such users. There were some reports that the list included some of the BJP IT cell members. And that caused outrage among the BJP IT cell members, leading to tweets such [like this](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CnFtYhGWEAAO0n1.jpg) from rishi (notice the date, just two days after Maneka's attack on abusive users).

After 4 years, some people found that tweet to be funny and shared it on twitter, Richa Chadha did the same. Then came the moron Bagree with [absurd reasons](https://twitter.com/rishibagree/status/1253611143282622465) claiming the tweet she shared is fake and [threatened](https://twitter.com/rishibagree/status/1253624497644552192) her for legal action if she didn't apologize to him. She then [apologized](https://twitter.com/RichaChadha/status/1253623633756520449) and deleted the shared tweet. Without knowing the truth, as usual, bhakts jumped the bandwagon of bullying her and even asked the moron rishi to ""not leave her"" wtf?

Then few twitter users proved that the tweet is not fake and the moron tweeted that for real [Proof 1](https://twitter.com/andh_bhakth_/status/1253628890200698880) [Proof 2](https://twitter.com/Joydas/status/1253678202926424064) [Proof 3](https://twitter.com/zoo_bear/status/1253702288419336198) [Proof 4](https://twitter.com/CatWomaniya/status/1253724299464265733).

Then the fellow bhakts came to bagree's help. [Here's](https://twitter.com/choga_don/status/1253704087046107136) one moron trying his hand at Microsoft paint, trying to mud-sling Richa and bagree retweeted it (deleted later, can't find the link rn). I mean how illiterate and idiotic one must be to not believe the proofs given and still hate people for telling the truth?

This is how propaganda works, guys, even if you debunk the fake news and present them with the facts, they are gonna abuse you and peddle fake news defaming you.

Sharing this with you guys because I thought that bagree's tweet of pleading to Amit Shah was funny, I mean working your ass off for a party only to be recognized as a *troll* by the same party minister? lmao, I would definitely hang myself in shame."

Yesterday, for the first time ever, I took part in a protest. A protest which would open my eyes and show me our country like I had never seen before. Despite having a general fear of being in a large crowd and being surrounded by people, I, for the first time ever, felt safe being in the middle of a literal ocean of people. I felt powerful; not in the sense that I alone had the power to influence, but in the sense that my presence contributed to OUR power to influence. Walking into the protest, I expected a lot of pushing and punching but to my surprise, I was not touched a single time. I had a better experience being in a crowd at a protest than I did being in a crowd at the Tirupati darshan. Despite the sheer volume of people present (over 1 lakh) the crowd was the most organized I had ever seen. Then I realised that there was only one thing that separated this crowd from any other crowd: lack of a selfish motive. Every person present did not come for their own personal gain, but for the gain of the country. Be it a crowd at a darshan or a crowd at a bazaar, everyone is there for their own personal benefit. Even at the school assembly, everyone seeks that one extra minute to complete their homework, one extra minute to form their lines, one extra minute to talk to their friends, all for personal gain; which makes the crowd at the assembly seem un-organized. But at this protest, the people represented the common voice on the streets, not themselves. No one expected to have gained anything at the end of the night. Which is what makes a protest so special. 

On the sight of me, my sister and my mom, a few protesters gave us a word of thanks for attending. They were happy to see Hindus taking part too. That made realise that despite this being a Muslim majority protest, it was not about the Muslims. It was not about fighting the government for being excluded. It was not about religion at all. It was, rather, about the absence of religion. About treating everyone as if religion didn't exist. It was not about fighting the government to be included in the list, it was about removing the list altogether. We were fighting for the up-keeing of the Constitution. A Constitution the ruling party does not seem to respect. Throughout our childhood in India, we were taught to look at religion and treat religions with respect. The problem didn't start when we were told to respect other religions, but when we were told to look at religion in the first place. Today when we read a name, the first thing we see is a religion. Lakshmi means Hindu, Ali means Muslim, John means Christian. I myself am guilty of this too but today, the protest showed me that despite religion being deep-rooted in our culture, we can learn to look past it.

A fact: public lunching has more than doubled since 2014, that is, since the BJP came to power. The victims of most of these lynchings were innocent Muslims. These murders have been left unresolved after the government refused to do anything about it. Mob lynchers have even credited Modi as their reason for feeling ""empowered"". Any voice of dissent against the government would be silenced by these lynchers. Today, these voices cannot be silenced. They cannot be killed. It's far too late for that. Finally, the government has received it's most worthy opposition: it's own people. A government which does not respect it's criticism is no government at all. The government is still trying to silence dissent in it's controlled states. UP, Karnataka and Delhi are facing the brunt of this; signs of fear in the ruling party. But every act to silence only raises more voices. And the unity of these voices creates waves; waves which make a difference.

That day I learnt the true meaning of unity in diversity. I learnt what India stands for. I learnt how powerful a protest really is. I learnt the power of unity. And no, Unity is not a 3000 crore statue. As we marched, we saw and heard slogans and chants, some abusing the government and some stating the objective, but there was one chant which stuck with me and kept me thinking about the state of our country: Hindu Muslim Sikh Isai, bhai bhai bhai bhai.

Jai Hind 🇮🇳"

?Hi fellow redditors,

I'm a 28 young man from [Belgium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium), my father is Belgian and my mother is Indian. My mother was born in Puducherry in the '60s from unknown parents, she was adopted at the age of 4 by a Belgian couple. Since she was adopted at an early age, she doesn't remember a lot things about India. As a result, my knowledge of India is very limited.

I'm not sure how I should reconnect with my Indian heritage since I don't really have family there. I bought books about the history of India and Hinduism. I plan to visit India in the future and I will probably start with the south of India. I'm considering learning Hindi or Tamil, I'm not sure which one would make the most sense for me to learn.

I have this crazy idea about going back to India, even though it seems like a bad move financially speaking, I feel like I could at least blend in with the locals, something that is not really possible in Belgium. What do you think about this?

This is because regardless of the duration of lockdown, India will not have herd immunity. Herd immunity is the phenomenon by which a disease's spread is negated through immunization and/or antibody immunity of a majority of the population. Since there is no vaccine for COVID-19 and antibody immunity is only restricted to those who have recovered from the infection, a second wave will arise from the patients left untreated or undetected. This second wave will spread just like the first one, needing only a few numbers in the start to grow, and only spare the ones with antibody immunity. Hence, regardless of lockdown, a second wave is imminent after relaxation unless a ban on travel is still present. Open to discussion"

What should I do?Hello guys,  
I am very frustrated with MagicBricks. This is a throwaway account.

I desperately needed money so I decided the best way would be to sell my shop through MagicBricks.

I bought their super titanium package for 13650 Rs on 18th March Evening. (Before lockdown)  

https://preview.redd.it/84599e4dvru41.png?width=1022&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c78b5e1b42171a683dda9a44e41276cb8f46970

&#x200B;

Now, I never received their services. The ad never went live. The photoshoot and other services were never received due to lockdown. I am also not able to visit the shop due to lockdown. Interested buyers also won't be able to visit the shop due to lockdown.  


So I asked for a refund by calling them. They created a support ticket and this is the email I received.

https://preview.redd.it/ofcudzvavru41.jpg?width=1586&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a0870d803967eb4ba8ec4924478d34ed96651236

  
They say the ad was on hold as per my confirmation. Without photoshoot, content writing, how is the ad suppose to go live?  On the other hand, they say they are now going to run the advertisement/services by the end of the day.  
No interested buyer would be able to visit the shop till lockdown. I replied to their ticket.  


https://preview.redd.it/91926q1ovru41.jpg?width=1573&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b0cf7b99d681d2a7e20faa34ea24de9a29812c2b

I replied to them that I want a refund, and this is their reply.  


https://preview.redd.it/e3n1g1sovru41.jpg?width=1562&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8c99a714487b04eb6e7a99753089f98ba18dbd27

They are now claiming that I have utilized their services, which I obviously haven't and couldn't! They now have enabled services. Without any good photos on the ad, there will be hardly any interested buyers Plus no interested buyers will be able to visit my shop due to lockdown. 

I am forced to delay my plan to sell the shop for a few months.  

I do not have much money left with me. It would take a few months for the shop to be sold. I am a small failed businessman, the banks & other entities won't lend me personal loans or any other loan without collateral. I feel I don't have any option anymore other than getting a loan on collateral.

Since I need money urgently, I cannot afford to wait for months. I have to cancel my plan to sell the shop and get a loan on collateral.  


Running ads at this time would be a total waste of money for me.

Also praying Taraweeh( ***Special prayers involving the reading of long portions of the Quran, as well as performing many rakahs (cycles of movement involved in Islamic prayer***)) is a Sunnah (***Sunnah*** ***is an action that was performed by our beloved prophet Muhammad S.A.W***), so dont abandon it and keep praying by staying in your house. Just a suggestion, you dont have to finish the whole Quran in Taraweeh, read the first 20 Surahs( **A Surah is the term for a chapter of the Quran** ) during the 20 Rakaats(  **one unit of Islamic prayer, or Salah** ) of Taraweeh and repeat the same everyday.

May this holy month bring peace, compassion and satisfaction in your life and keep everyone away from any harm.

I was planning to buy a decent mid-premium laptop anything below Rs. 1.3 Lakhs.

I'm not a hardcore gamer, so not looking for a fancy graphic card, but anything that fits casual gaming (mostly CS GO) should be alright.

I plan to use it to learn Python and R. I would also love to experience other Linux based systems (either through VMware or dual boot)

Other than that, most of my time will be spent on  viewing movies and web-browsing (which any standard laptop can do)

Accordingly I believe the following specifications would be good

Intel i7 10th Gen processor
16 GB RAM
512GB /1TB SSD or 1TB HDD with 128 GB SSD
A decent display (4K would be ideal but not mandatory)
Light-weight and preferably touch screen (2-in-1s)
A decent audio setup


Would love your recommendations.
Also if you've purchased a laptop within this price range, and have any suggestions, I would love to hear them out.

Thanks."

But, **why do we need ventilators so desperately? Are they the only solution to fight against deadly coronavirus?** According to Brian Oliver, a respiratory disease researcher and an Associate Professor at the University of Technology, Sydney (UTS) the ventilator can decide life and death for severe COVID-19 patients. Like Pneumonia, in COVID-19 lungs are filled with fluid and pus which makes it difficult to breathe. A ventilator becomes the only way to make the respiration process easier by moving oxygen into such parts of the lungs that aren’t badly damaged by the virus.

the case of a lower caste disadvantaged person The rare ones who do happen to break out of it  if they were lucky enough to get some sort of support in the form of reservations and familial financial support and have the fortitude to survive the education system without being discriminated against They still face an uphill struggle wherever they end up working at More so if its a government workplace If they excel and do better than their peers theyre subject to allegations of having cheated and get corruption cases filed against them And after having to face all of this shit in their career are left with little to no wherewithal to be what they wish they had when they were young  a mentor godfather or a role model to their own kind Just like in the other powerful castes ahem communities And thats where the current shaakas are capitalising on Catching them young Keeping them dumb Not letting them rise Making them hate each other and the Muslims whore no different than they are Driving away the missionaries who come with an education package A core feature of a hierarchy is that it is designed to always make anyone whos not at the very top nor at the very bottom to have someone to feel superior to And those at the lower ladders are at a double whammy position where theyre not enlightened enough to realise the harm theyre doing unto themselves by being part of some of the heinous crimes you hear of in places like TNAnyway its a shit show Im envious that a majority of the caste denying elitists here dont have to see or imagine any of this and live their grand privileged lives envying that one SC guy who drove a BMW No political party every stands for them KA has had exceptional leaders from such castes for decades and theyre never allowed to rise up Its by design Nobody can break out of it', 'Your analysis is quite correct  and the reason Islamophobia is growing because many lower caste ar getting educated and thanks to propaganda they are likely to see Islam more of a threat compared to Brahminism A small example of how Manusmriti ideology has even engulfed DalitsI happened to meet One of my batchmate who used to be a torched bearer of Ambedkarism in our university  we both are DalitsI was shocked to see idols of gods and the blatant karmkand things in his house which he used to vehemently opposeI just asked him that what happened to you in all this years His reply was  Ye Buddhism Jai bhim wagerah mein maaza nahi hain  kya milta hai Buddhist banke enjoyement apne hindu religion mein hi hain I got so many things when I started following hindu religion Jai bhim banenege toh koi bhi festival nahi hain Kya matlab uskaI just told him that your job degree is only because several decades back a man fought for it with the establishment if not for him you would be  sewering in a gutter and doing what you are supposed to doMany backward castes which have become affluent due to capitalism post s are more hindus and more casteist than the Brahmins  like Yadavs  Gujjars Marathas who are more indulged in caste based atrocities compared to the Brahmins ', 'I think you make valid points regarding a why BJP has gained the reserved seats and b caste politics has been overshadowed by the unifying hatred against the MuslimsWe all probably agree with uAndroid that the reason for b is not so much the effective implementation of welfare schemes but the successful deployment of polarising techniques by BJP and its media cohorts That said I find their optimism that Modilahar might wane slightly misplaced for three reasons i there is no indication that these polarising techniques have lost their efficiency ii as the present pandemic has given the Center sweeping powers regular administrative functions and even botched operations are now going to be touted as Modis achievements and iii the voting behaviour in state elections can be the opposite in central elections case in point Jharkhand which they refer toAnother shortcoming which I find in the print commentariat as they try to understand why Dalits vote for BJP is the shallowness of their analyses Best exemplified by Dilip Mondals article that you linked they fail to answer why is it that Dalit voters especially in urban areas dont rally behind radical Dalit leaders It would require a much lengthier writeup but I suspect that it is the lure of savarna ethic and the success of capitalism which they are led into believing owing to the constant media propaganda and the ineptitude of parliamentary Left in India Please note that I am not saying the savarna ethic is worth emulating or that capitalism is actually successful quite the opposite I would say But such is the hegemonising power that the cultural elite have a point noted by Gramsci and successive othersThe savarna ethic is a selfreplicating one a virus One can see that many OBCs and many Dalits become strident defenders of Brahmanism once they acquire a certain degree of social mobility Led into thinking that their emancipation is because of the savarna ethic and not despite of it many try to abnegate their Dalit identity itself The same can be said about capitalism it is the lure of this heady cocktail of Baniya capitalism that fuels India and shapes Dalit politics outside the safe spaces of universities today In such a context it is difficult for a Bahujan combine to have any real political teeth though not impossible To begin with such a possibility requires a theoretical agreement between the political actors', 'I hope hes not talking about installing pay to use toilets everywhere', 'DBT Swach Ujjwala Yojana Awas Yojana', 'Odd username but anyway Poverty literally increased under modi so did unemployment and income inequality I dont doubt it  I should remind you that UPA under Manmohan uplifted record number of people after poverty in a decade a record only second to china farmers too which constitute most of the backward people in India did far better under Manmohan I totally agree with that Whats getting them vote is organised hatred they spread online Indian people are gullible and BJP were quick to capitalise on thatThis is what I dont agree with I thought it was bullshit but what he is doing is working Even if he is doing the barest minimum  I should add if you think upper castes think any better of the backward ones now youre wrong Nobodys enlightened they just have a bigger enemy for now If hypothetically muslims were removed the caste system will reach its former glory in no timeI agree And caste violence has increased under Modi Which is why its so perplexing that Modis Dalit voteshare has increased']","The real loser in India's errupting Islamaphobia: Caste politics.TLDR: My (unqualified) opinion is that dalit political movement has seen the most erosion in the anti-muslim appraoch the government has championed.

Note: This post is for discussion. If you have nothing but belligerent responses that add nothing to the conversation I will report you. If you only have worn out, down over a thousand times arguments of being caste blind, having merit and anti reservation nonsense, I will be ignoring you. 

Now that I've gotten that out of the way, lets talk.

The anti muslim sentiment grows stronger even in lockdown, with the hindu right finding more ways to demonize muslims everyday. I didnt think it could be possible, but every day it seems they have a new angle of attack. 

And such it has been since day 1 i.e. the day the 2014 elections results came out when the muslim techie was murdered by a hindu mob and that mosque attack happened, I'm forgetting where. The very day of the results. Modi hadnt even taken up PMship that day. 

So to begin, Anti-Muslim rhetoric creates a unified Hindu identity. This is something that BJP has long worked for and was one of the goals of VHP, HM and RSS since their inception - create a Hindu identity that trumps caste indentity so that the caste status quo is maintained while killing any caste discourse. 

Now, I'm muslim. And I have no intention of blaming Dalits for the victory of BJP. Dalits, much like Muslims, have been promised much by politicians purporting to be their champions but delivery has been less than spectacular. Lalu's first term & Maywati's first full term withstanding, no government has been able to delivery upon their promises to their dalit and obc voter very much. So yes, I do not blame these communities for voting outside their 'champions', for 'fracturing' the community vote. 

But the fact remains that Modi's government has done spectacular work for the backward communities (barring muslims). We in urban areas scoff at the Modi governments but their work for the financially weak and socially disadvantaged has been phenomenal. From being called ""Congress + Cow"" it has been jokingly called ""Prakash Karat + Cow"". Such is the success of Modi's socialist policies that I have to begrudgingly accept it as the unequivocal truth.

But coming to the matter at hand, OBC representation in Parliament has been dropping and sarvana i.e. upper caste repesentation is increasing. Now, Dalits have reserved seats so while their count can not decrease, but this seat reservation is working against them. I'm going to copy paste directly from an article here to explain this

[Not a single constituency in India has more than 50 per cent Dalit population, which means it’s always the non-Dalits who decide the fate of Dalit candidates in reserved constituencies. A vocal or assertive Dalit leader has the least chance of winning from such seats. To be re-elected, a Dalit MP must be careful not to antagonise the non-Dalits, and one way of ensuring this is by remaining silent in Parliament.](https://theprint.in/opinion/17th-lok-sabha-looks-set-to-confirm-ambedkars-fears-no-vocal-dalits-in-parliament/232383/)

Note that Balasaheb knew this would happen. Which is why he proposed that non dalits not be given a vote on reserved seats. I am very much with him on this.

So who is the loser here? Mayawati has lost her base. There can be no doubt about it. The BSP+SP combine failed because SP votes were transfered to BSP but the BSP vote was not. Why? Because Dalits find BJP a more attractive proposition than BSP.  Who else? Lalu and Mulayam have lost a significant base altho this could be attributed to multiple reasons. It is also less significant because OBC leaders are many. Dalit leaders are few. 

While Chandrashekar 'Raavan' Azad has made a great big splash, he is being kept under hold by the government almost since day 1. He has the appeal to be a mass leader and present a large potential threat to the status quo. But he has been muzzled and jailed as often as was possible. 

Ultimately even the news cycles focus on muslim, and the caste conflicts happeneing everyday take a backseat, all the while forgetting that 85% of Indian Muslims are lower caste muslims. Here too, the muslim identity has trumped the caste identity and they are doubly the losers here considering that most muslim victim to Islamaphobic attack tend to be the under privileged and of backward caste.

This is all by design, mind you. The idea here is the same I mentioned earlier. Maintain caste status quo and the cost of caste identity. And its working.

Note that Modi himself never speaks about caste. Despite being an OBC he never mentions caste struggles and his own caste related experiences. So his being OBC does not bring more visibility to the problems of the oppressed castes.

https://preview.redd.it/cjt1cicmiqu41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=e226c05d68c73b5d28faccd0aa46ada0cd138105

### Tl;dr

Since remote work, online education, telemedicine, and reliance on e-retail becomes critical for the foreseeable future there is a need for authorities to take specific action. IFF has written to the DoT and TRAI suggesting that these interventions must look toward overcoming the digital divide, appreciating the importance of the internet and mobile services as an essential utility, and protect net neutrality. Towards this IFF recommends concerted stakeholder dialogue, evidence based interventions to support network capacity, efforts to use government funds towards providing free access to internet services to underprivileged/essential cohorts of people, ensuring all areas have access to high speed internet access and expediting the implementation of a net neutrality enforcement framework.

### Background

The lockdown has seen greater reliance of many segments of the populace on information and communications technologies, in particular the internet. People are using the medium for various purposes such as remotely working from home, distance learning, ordering essential items via e-retail, and telemedicine purposes. More generally, people also use it to stay in touch with their friends, family and loved ones, which is crucial to people’s mental health in these trying times.

In various guidances and notifications, telecommunication and internet services have been repeatedly classified by the Ministry of Home Affairs as essential items. In this regard, the importance of internet and telecommunications access has assumed considerable importance during the current public health crisis. It also brings with its own set of policy and regulatory challenges which must be addressed. If unaddressed, we believe there is a risk that the novel coronavirus may exaggerate the digital/technological divide; stress underlying network infrastructure and risk network neutrality.

### Prior Correspondence with the DoT and TRAI

In a letter dated March 18, 2020 IFF previously wrote to the Hon’ble Minister of Communications and copied this to the DoT and TRAI. In it we anticipated that there may be a risk of undue pressure on underlying internet and mobile networks due to shifts and likely increases in network usage. Therefore we suggested authorities:

1. Conduct periodic reviews of telecom infrastructure in consultation with telecom and internet service providers, content providers, startups and consumer facing organisations. Here, we stressed on the importance of preserving principles of net neutrality.
2. Encourage voluntary pledges by telecom companies towards not terminating people’s connections, due to an inability to pay their bills.
3. Urged the Central Government to issue an advisory that States and Union Territories should not issue internet suspension or restriction orders under the Telecommunications Suspension Rules, 2017.

### So Why Are We Writing This Time?

This is because there are new threats which are emerging, since the commencement of our over month long national lockdown.

### 1. Threat to Net Neutrality

In a letter dated March 21, 2020 the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) wrote to TRAI requesting for clearance of charges for voice and data for certain websites and telephone numbers. Additionally, an Economic Times [**report** ](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/telcos-suggest-free-access-to-critical-sites/articleshow/74784534.cms?from=mdr)suggested concessions to zero rate certain essential websites pertaining to government services, ecommerce and digital payments applications like the BHIM app, without being charged for data during the lockdown period.

To be sure, TRAI’s Prohibition of Discriminatory Tariffs for Data Services Regulations, 2016, which ostensibly prohibits zero rating of data tariffs in India does allow for exemptions. However, we must consider such developments along with the fact that COAI has also written to online video content providers, to reduce their bitrates to alleviate stress on underlying network infrastructure. By referencing measures taken by online content providers in jurisdictions like Europe, we have noticed that most participants in the Indian market have complied and reduced their offerings to SD bitrates.

These measures have been taken by industry and have been taken with little evidence available to the public of the actual stress being placed on India’s underlying networks, owing to the national lockdown being excessive. India’s internet infrastructure has traditionally been characterised as underutilised, and therefore even according to existing capacities should be able to handle a 20 percent surge in network traffic. This fact may be contrasted with reports which found that mobile internet use (India’s wireline subscriber base remains very less) only increased by 10 percent in the month of March 2020. Pertinently, in Tier 1 metros the increase was even more modest at 3-5 percent.

Thus, it may be concluded that without appropriate review and response mechanisms, there is a threat to India’s net neutrality regime. As such net neutrality in India remains imperfect owing to the fact that we are yet to finalise a definition of what falls under reasonable traffic management practices, and actual means of monitoring and enforcement. This lacuna in the framework has meant internet access providers in India can avoid compliance net neutrality obligations, under licensing conditions, with relative impunity. We have previously [**written to the government about these concerns in March and May, 2019 respectively**](https://internetfreedom.in/net-neutrality-in-india-needs-to-find-its-bearings/).

### 2. Risk of the Digital and Technological Divide

It is reasonable to conclude that the pandemic is sure to hit those working in informal sectors and marginalised communities at large the hardest.

A recent report on [**The Print**](https://theprint.in/india/education/no-gadgets-no-studies-what-online-classes-mean-for-16-lakh-poor-students-in-delhi-schools/406837/) and an article by Mr [**Osama Manzar (Digital Empowerment Foundation, Founding Director)**](https://www.apc.org/en/blog/def-we-need-free-talk-time-and-internet-during-covid-19) are instructive in this regard. The Print article discusses how the coronavirus is shifting students to distant learning situations reliant on online/IVR based classes/educational setups. This means that in areas like Delhi, students from underprivileged backgrounds are at a distinct disadvantage owing to a lack of digital literacy, no availability of supporting equipment in the household like laptops and smartphones, chargers, and no access to high speed internet connections.

Similarly, Mr Manzar’s article also communicates that aside from internet access, many people from informal/marginalised backgrounds do not even have access to basic mobile connections as well. He illustrates this with the recent exodus from urban to rural areas after the announcement of the national lockdown. In it many people travelled in groups-- to the detriment of social distancing protocols.  This is because the availability of phones with talk time to make calls, was often restricted to one or two persons in large groups. And in such times of hardship, the ability to make a timely phone call to a friend or family member can be a question of life and death.

### IFF’s Recommendations

Keeping the above considerations in mind we urged the Ministry of Communications, DoT and TRAI to collectively consider the following interventions:

1. **Regular Review and Reports on Impact of  COVID-19 on Internet Capacity**: India should have twice a week meetings between DoT, TRAI, TSPs/ISPs, internet exchange points, CDN providers, cloud service providers, content providers, small businesses, video conferencing app developers, consumer groups and so on, to ascertain the actual impact COVID-19 is having on internet capacity and quality of service. The findings from these meetings along with support evidence should be published for the public at large. This will be analogous to the approach adopted by European authorities like BEREC.
2. **Consider Means to Expand Telecom Infrastructure Capacity:** Although India’s internet infrastructure has traditionally been characterised as under utilised, Indian authorities must be alive to the possibility that there may be a need to consider means through which it can ease network maintenance and deployment of internet access services. India must consider steps in this regard. For instance, it may consider discussions with TSPs to maintain an open dialogue on the need to expand network capacity, upgrading network equipment, capacity expansions of base stations in mobile networks, etc. It should also consider the need to free up access to particular airwaves to ensure networks are up and running in an interference free manner.
3. **Expedite Final Recommendations and Implementation of TRAI’s Net Neutrality Consultation:** Considering advances being made by internet access providers which seek exceptions to the net neutrality frameworks, it becomes even more imperative that India expedites its finalisation of its definition for reasonable traffic management practices. At the same time there is a need for more robust monitoring, enforcement and institutions. Therefore, it becomes necessary for authorities to conclude its findings on the latest TRAI [**consultation**](https://main.trai.gov.in/consultation-paper-traffic-management-practices-tmps-and-multi-stakeholder-body-net-neutrality) on traffic management practices and a multistakeholder body for net neutrality.
4. **Consider Means for Free Wi-Fi Hotspots, Access to Laptops/Smartphones and 4G Router Availability:** We have urged DoT and TRAI to consider commencing an initiative which deploys funds available under the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF). Along these lines, we also recommend they consider possibilities of working with the Ministry of Home Affairs and state governments to gauge availability of funds under the National Disaster Relief Fund and State Disaster Response Funds. These funds should be used toward facilitating public wi-fi hotspots, 4G routers, internet devices and so on, in particular targeting benefiting students from underprivileged backgrounds, informal workers, healthcare workers, first responders, and people from marginalised communities. 
5. **Urge industry to not disconnect people’s internet/mobile services, and provide free data during lockdown period:** Indian authorities and access service providers should identify vulnerable groups who would benefit from such targeted interventions, which help with the response but also help bridge the digital divide. We would also suggest TRAI and DoT work together with access providers in ensuring that people can have uninterrupted access to their internet and mobile services even if they fall behind on their payments or recharge schedules. Under utilised funds in USOF may be a useful tool in this regard as well.
6. **Urge States and UTs to Maintain Access Full Speed Mobile and Internet Connectivity During Lockdown:** We urged central authorities to consider ways to limit government powers to issue directives which throttle the internet. Therefore, we recommended the issuance of an advisory which urges states to not issue any directions which suspend internet access or impose restrictions on accessing high speed internet.

The whole process took 30 seconds but the wait was longer because of they were testing from 50 wards today. Doctors waiting in the room in PPE kits swab you in thirty seconds. On a scale of 1 to 10, pain level was at most 6. 


The only cons were, no sanitizers for people waiting. No social distancing maintained (even in the transportation) and no one even asking people to do so. I got looks when I told the guy around me to move away a little bit. Although, everyone was wearing a mask, which is good to see.



According to the officials there, they will ramp up the testing and are looking to test people from every ward in Dibrugarh district over the next few weeks. I wanted to take a video of the procedure but was not allowed. But yeah, it isn't very painful.

That however maybe entirely coincidental.
Their parents homeschool their children and teach them their values and traditions and beliefs which is totally ok.
But however they are being fed huge factual errors and the fumes of racism and Western hate too and are made to preach these things in the name of an ""organic , healthy lifestyle"".
This kid is even made to justify sati and they have even uploaded videos of their children proving textbooks wrong and just pointing out baseless.. gibberish which were science facts.
Its totally ok if they rejoice their cultures, religion and scriptures or whatever but their preaching and their facts are very wrong and extremely bigotry.
And if you notice before each video of their children reciting or explaining anything they put the age.. which indicates that they want to glean attention of media and become famous for raising self proclaimed prodigies.
It's pretty much like the licypriya scam.

I know this is not the type of post you would see on here regularly but I don’t know where else to go for advice 

So being a 22 year old guy I obviously use tinder, it never really meant anything I just kept swiping on profiles for no reason but all that changed when I matched with a girl back in November 2019. 

I’ve always thought that relationships were stupid and I’ve never been in one but she changed my view on that, we started dating in December and things were going great but due to reasons I don’t want to mention we broke up in early March, it’s been almost 2 months now and I think I’m finally over her (this was my first relationship) 

I now realise how amazing relationships can be and now I want to be in one and make it work.As of now I’ve deleted tinder because I find it to be stupid due to the massive difference in sex ratio and also I can’t match with the women I find attractive, I just have to sit around and wait hoping that they will swipe on me. I want to change that, I want to take initiative and go out and meet women on my own, I don’t want to depend on online dating 

And here’s the thing I don’t know how to do that. I’m an introverted person and I’m very shy due to this I have very few friends who are also introverted and don’t have much experience in dating. One of my friends suggested that I go to bar and meet women, I’ve never been to a bar before and I don’t drink either but I’m open to that and also I don’t know how to approach women at a bar because I feel indian girls are unlikely to talk to me if I approach them because I’m a stranger, I might be wrong here idk 

I have a cousin who’s a 28M and he’s never been in a relationship and he always keeps blaming women that they’re only after your money and nothing else, due to this mindset he’s been single all his life and doesn’t see the faults within him and since he keeps blaming them he doesn’t take the initiative to change. I really don’t want to end up like him ( lonely and sad ) 

I would really appreciate if you guys can help me out regarding this or share some similar experiences maybe 

And also if there are women reading this, I’d love some advice on how to approach you 

Thank you for reading ! And also please no social distancing jokes, I understand the situation right now 

P.S - I don’t know if it matters but I forgot to mention I live in Bangalore"

Conversely I think of growing old in India. I don't think I want to burden my family if I have one with my old age at the same time I don't want to end up in a care or oldage home in India which is still looked down upon as a place for abandoned poor souls.

Can I do something?Hi guys,

My mom's college has not paid this month's salary yet, to any of the employee. From teachers, to peons and guards. 

Now it's one thing to not give salary to senior staff for whatever reason but for low salaried workers like peons and guards, they might already be going through hell because of lockdown. Not recieving their salary will be a big punch in their gut. 

Can they do this? Didn't the government instructed organizations to not cut salary or lay off employees? Was it just some recommendation or is there a law and people can take action if someone doesn't follow it? 

I'm not mentioning the name of the college (yet) until I have some direction to think. It's a private one in Indore.

My mom is senior teacher and we're only worried about the low wage workers at the moment. She told me that talking to the college authorities will be a waste of time because they are really toxic and don't entertain these talks.

Please suggest me something.

Edit: One more clarification - Teachers here are still working full-time. My mom has to take lectures, report back with student attendence, and other duties. I forgot to mention it earlier.

And about funds, as you might know, colleges collect fee in advance. This semester was already paid off by students."

Is it a signal that he has served his purpose and now can be done away with..?
Or has he mistakenly questioned his masters (remember how a while ago godi-media was asking questions to BJP which left them fuming) and the masters want to set an example for everyone by mock-atracking him...
Has he asked too much of a price, we do know he got a shiny new office right after elections..?
Is he trying to garner sympathy coz Maharashtra CM has said that people who are giving undue communal angle to Palghar lynching will be taken to task..?

1) Diverting attention from the International embarrassment post Kuwaiti fiasco, lest the chinks in armour show up.

2) Combining all allegations against Congress to topple the Maharashtra Govt."

No country is in a position to recover from this hit anytime soon and nobody is dreaming of getting back to their last quarter performance anytime in the next five years, except Amazon, maybe.

But I hear people comparing this country's bailout with that country's stimulus package and it's a horrible metric to be judging a country's fiscal astuteness on.

At least right side up.

Turn the metric around. The smaller the amount of money the government prints the better it is for the country. Every country that printed free money went broke. Zimbabwe, Iran, Venezuela, Japan is heading there as we speak. America is going to have to go to war to make up for this hit its economy is going to take, that's a given. Whether it's a literal war or a Trump war is up in the air.

But I digress. The point is, we are in a much better position as an economy to recover hopefully at a safe and healthy rate. As long as we continue to not print any more free money."

Later at session end, when i asked how to payment and stuff doctor just smiled and said "" Get well and lets see about the payment.""

My brain can't process this things properly. I thanked and said have a good day, then later i asked the assistant what to do, doctor said nothing about payment.

So I live in Ghaziabad (Delhi NCR basically) and I am now passed out from this school. I went to buy some stuff a hour earlier and these dogs attacked me. As I am good with dogs I was able to save myself. But it reminded me of something that happened in our school 3 years ago. And it really makes my blood boil that the situation isn't any better. These dogs have been a nuisance for a long time. And before I get hate I want to tell you I am a huge dog lover and I was used to feed strays all the time in my ex society. Just think how these kids must be feeling going to school everyday with a disfigured face which was no fault of theirs. Their poor parents complained to the municipality office but they didn't do shit. Some of us can deal with dogs but just think of a kid or your little brother. His first reflex would be to run and God knows what he can do. My neighbour comes home late from work every night and he is always feels threatened that one day a dog may bite him and this is the problem with India as a whole we just wait for something bad to happen before taking any action. Its pretty frustrating to not be able to go for a morning walk without feeling safe.

And politicians like Maneka Gandhi who probably have never stepped out of her car doesn't know what problem these dogs pose to two wheeler owners and pedestrians. 

I also understand that I can't demonize all stray dogs because some stray dogs are aggressive but do you have a better solution. And look I am a leftist humanist and whatever so I do believe in equality but equality is a vague term. Equality means equality of equals you can't go and ask for reservations that SC/ST gets on the argument that you both are human and equal. So don't give me shit like dogs are equal and tbfh they are not I do agree that they have the right to coexist with us in this planet but humans are the priority and there is no denying that. If you think dog life equal human life you should probably wake from your damn utopia. People like this piss me the most saying ""oh but you can't do that if a human kills or rapes someone you can't wipe of humanity"" but you sure can wipe out that human. In simple words stray dogs are pests that threaten humans and should be dealt with the most humane way possible I also don't support mass killing but people who think there is no problem I hope you get fucking biten.

I think people should report aggressive dogs and they should be killed without any protests through injections.
All females need to be sterilized and all dogs should get vaccinated and stuff so we can decrease chance of rabies.
As population goes down shelters should be built to keep them in the shelters and awareness should be spread that how low maintenance they are and they make a great pet (which is true my dad had one)."

This is to promote a healthy debate.
I in no way support dictatorship, authoritarianism or anything like that. I am very proud of our democratic traditions however flawed they might be, you can't deny they have held well since independence and I hope they stay strong forever. This can be said to be a case study.

So Iets start with China which have a single party authoritative form of government. And if you compare our economies till 1980 things were pretty similar. Similar populations, similar gdp, similar poverty levels etc. But in just 30 years China have literally left us in the dust in matters of economy and there is no denying that. Now, I do think we have done pretty well ourselves but it's not enough considering our huge population. The thing is whatever you say about the lack of freedom in China etc etc. There government get things done. For eg. How they cleaned up Beijing's pollution problem with a good laid out effective plan. That's a huge flaw of democracy. The time it takes to reach a conclusion is often devastatingly slow. Now, ofcourse I think democracy is the better form of government as people get to participate in the decision making process. But here stems the first question,
 
Do you think it's good for a country LIKE India?
Once you reach a certain level of development I think democracy is a better choice but do you think for a country like India or a  third world country, a country that is just corrupt and have many problems. Will democracy be a good choice. I mean I can't name many third world countries that became developed following democratic principles (The West is definitely not developed due to democracy. Yeah colonialism I am looking at you.) I think you need a government which can make decisions quick and effectively. Now the whole problem with this is that if we give power to a single party or person no one gets to question them and they can abuse their power for their own benefit. So it can go two ways, Either you get someone like Mao Zedong (Who is a fucking moron) or a Deng Xiaoping (Who is a fucking legend. Literally pulled China out of the junk.) So the second question is,

If you get a smart dictator (like Deng Xiaoping) will you prefer an authoritarian government?
Now with all this will definitely come a problem of shutting a few mouths and stuff as there will always be opposition to change. So some civil liberties will be naturally be curbed in a government of this type. So the third question is, 

Will you be willing to trade your civil liberties with a guarantee that the regime will make the country developed?

We can see examples of this in the Four Asian Tigers. Let's restrict it to South Korea and Singapore. Singapore had a great dictator in Lee Kuan. He changed a small country's destiny in a few decades. (Deng Xiaoping proved it can be done on a larger scale as well). And then you look at South Asia which isn't doing great at all! We have Sri Lanka with their civil war. Pakistan with their Coup. Nepal which isn't doing well and Bangladesh isn't doing well either. Also South Korea later turned to a democracy and I think they are doing great. So the last question is,

Will you accept an authoritarian government if it will turn to a democracy later when things settle down?
(Though this is rare)

So tell me what you think guys! I just want India to be a country that the world appreciate. Because undoubtedly there is no country in the world that will be as great as India once it is a developed country."

college and work as a programmer I used to do a lot of android back in college but now Im really big on php laravel a bit of R and python and possess some superficial level of knowledge on C and C from what I learnt back in college and school Ive tried a variation of most of the options here the best thing that worked out for me is to just use the official documentation for whatever language  tool that you want to learn and see what they recommend an example is if you want to learn vue js then just study their entire documentation and try out all the examples and then try a sample project that youve wanted to do if you dont know what project you want to implement them search for good project ideas online on medium or GitHub or reddit or wherever some tech like android have their own offical course by googlers themselves and from what I remember they really were good so it really depends on each of the tech but the official one is the best there might be some cases where the official documentation sucks in which case you have to start thinking if whether the languagetooltech you are learning really is a good one because usually most good tech has good documentation and a lot of people contributing to it except in really really rare casesOnce you know the language the next thing you would probably want to do is how to write the code in a neater way I personally would recommend books on writing clean code Clean Code is a personal favourite of mine and then read books on design patterns take this in slowly because I ended up reading them too quickly the first time without even understanding this properly and fucked up my code big time on a project and Im still paying for the flaws Ive made and watch videos of the conferences that these tech holds it helps you be updated and see what the top guys of these tech are upto and what they recommendAs for competitive programming it really depends on what your end goal is I usually get this occasional itch where I dont want to develop something but I just want to program during these times I just log onto a competitive programming site and then just pick a random problem and then try to solve it and end up learning a data structure or algorithm technique if you want to get good at this then many of the competitive programming websites have a lot of tutorials and stuff I would recommend the book How to solve it by computing as a fairly simpler introduction to competitive programming and algorithms if the resources online are overwhelming Some good competitive programming websites would be topcoder

**1) Indira Gandhi government was of opinion that east Bangladeshi parties coming to power in combined Pakistan assembly would moderate west Pakistan's obsession with Kashmir**

So , I need to give a little background . Before the Bangladesh liberation war really gathered steam , a student protest had already broken our in West and east Pakistan against dictator Ayub Khan . The movement demanded the restoration of democracy in combined Pakistan . When the situation became too hot to handle , the Pakistani military stepped in and deposed Ayub khan . It was decided to hold elections soon .

Now , you need to know that population wise , the population of Bangladeshis in east Pakistan was numerically greater than population of West Pakistan . 

In the elections that followed that , Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his party Awami league won a landslide victory in East Pakistan . They won almost every seat in East Pakistan (awami league lost only 2 seats ) and emerged as the single largest party in combined Pakistan national assembly.Bhutto and his People's party were the second largest but nowhere near majority.

This was a shock election results for the Pakistani military establishment and Bhutto who had thought that west Pakistani dominance in national assembly was inevitable.

The Indian government found this result as optimistic for India . We thought that the Bengali politicians of East Pakistan would care less about Kashmir and would start an era of better relationship with India . Thus as a result , in the initial days of the liberation movement , India wasn't really keen on an independent Bangladesh as that would mean an even more rabid west Pakistan with regards to Kashmir 

**2) Indira Gandhi government was afraid of leftist elements in Bangladeshi independence movement . She was afraid that once they attain independence , they will give support to the Maoist - naxal insurgency raging in West Bengal**

The cold war geopolitics had caused Pakistan to join the side of capitalist America and the west . 

Meanwhile in India , a Maoist insurgency was raging in West Bengal and East India .

Indira Gandhi and her government was afraid that once Bangaldesh attained independence , the left elements involved in the liberation movement would give refuge and support to the Maoist insurgents in West Bengal ( which was not currently happening since Pakistan was on the American side )

As a result , members of Indira Gandhi government were of opinion that it was better if east Pakistan remained part of Pakistan 

**3) Soviet Union was afraid that an independent Bangladesh would be a Chinese ally**

Before the liberation movement , the sino-soviet split had taken place . The communist world was taking the side of either China or Soviet Union .

Soviet Union was afraid that the Maoist section of the Bangaldesh liberation movement would push them towards the China camp .

As a result , Soviet Union warned India against any drastic action in Bangladesh .

They kept this position until Indira Gandhi herself went to Moscow and held a 5 hour meeting with the top leader to brief them on the ongoing genocide in East Pakistan (operation searchlight ) . She also reminded them of their obligation under Indo-Soviet friendship treaty . It was after this meeting that Soviet Union finally changed their position and sided with India 

**4) America was afraid that break up of Pakistan would derail the ongoing negotiations between China - USA which was being done via Pakistan . As a result Nixon threatened India that any war against Pakistan will be expensive for India**

The green Revolution hadn't taken place yet . India had a ship to mouth existence where American aid to poor countries like India kept us afloat . America used to send food package and other relief measures to India regularly . 

If America had suspended those relief packages and placed sanctions on us , we would have been in great trouble . On top of those  , if they had placed more sanctions on us , our economic system would have collapsed .

As a result , we had to take any decision seriously."

Again fine till now. But then online giants come and sell the same product at huge discount and as consumer even I get excited seeing this but deep down I always know this will ruin the traditional brick and mortar shops.

From there, their love story blossoms. But one day the guy sees another guy flirting with her and gets mad,stops responding to her call. Then she meets him in the office and tells him it was misunderstanding and the other guy was misbehaving and they confess their love for each other.

Do you not think the situation in India is going to worsen more because of lockdowns than the coronavirus itself? And obviously everything going wrong because of continued lockdowns will aid to coronavirus spread.

Middle class families will soon give up on staying home. They just can't continue. People are loosing jobs. Companies are withdrawing job offers (even from IITs).

Do you not think low number(relatively) of cases in India has kept everyone from understanding seriousness of situation and people have slowly started to or will act irresponsible?"

Yesterday I received a video on Whatsapp presenting data about the coronavirus in your country.

The narrator showed interesting statics regarding number of infection and deaths from the new virus. It seems India has a relatively low death rate per million if comparing with other dense populations nations. 

The video attribute these lower rates of death and infection to a homeopathic intervention. 

I have a very scientific mind and it wasn't easy to believe or process this kind of information so I thought it would be wiser to just ask you guys what's happening.

My family has no objection with her and they're just worried about my safety.

Our families are quite opposite

her younger sister is 20 year old and married, my elder brother is 30 year old and bachelor. (he has no plan of marrying till 35)

Currently I do freelancing for social media marketing and earn $500-2k per month {approx $1k}

we're in relationship for 5 years, we both are kinda shy and sweet. so, we both never had fight with ourselves (or even anyone else as a individual!)

I'm athiest (born hindu) but she is religious and do 5x namaz/day, goes to madarsa but still she is pretty chill and open-minded. I'm into dank memes. she never gets offended in any dark memes of her religion.  (she is unicorn)

Her home is in colony (where her 200-300 relatives lives too). so, there is risk of getting lynched by mob while dropping her or picking her. (because I'm hindu)

&#x200B;

Actually I had no intention of marrying till age 30 but I love her so much that I'm even ready to get circumcision for her. and since she wants to marry. so, offcourse I will. I'm willing to do anything for her.

So, the issue is that my family want me to wait few years but in her family there relatives are recommending her mom to marry her with her cousin. (also, they don't know about our relationship and will definitely be against me)

Ever since this govt has come to power, people have been calling out for its anti- dalit/women/ minority stance... But this has only furthered their image and has strengthened their resolve to spew more and more venom on the country...

Isn't it high time to rather focus our time spent in social media to rather exposing the misdeeds on economical front..? It may not sound appealing, and it's slow... But as a matter of fact it is lot more effective... Remember how much of a problem Rafael was..? Alas, they soon turned it into nationalism (remember Pulwama..?) and we forgot everything about questioning Rafael...

So let's focus of Economic exposures of this govt, and only then it's control can truly come to the hands of the people as our constitution makers had envisaged...

We can't expect media to do the job, we need to crowd source it by pooling our own individual talent... Shouldn't we.?

So, I recently spent 2 weeks travelling around parts of India (just missing the corona lockdown!).

I fell in love with all the varieties of traditional food I tried, it put to shame the “Indian food” back here in England.

I discovered I’m more of a Northern Indian food fan, favouring bread over rice etc and the flavours. 

One of my favourite dishes was this vegetarian thali so I’m trying my best to recreate it for myself now that I’m home, can anyone point me in the direction of a good recipe or cookbook?

Thanks in advance."

Now,
Why India is not able to get sufficient antibody kits ,is it due to shortage of funds ,less seriousness of this pandemic or some other reason.

How Maharashtra government has been able to test more compared to other states ?? How are they able to procure test kits more compared to Madhya Pradesh or other states ?"

> Netflix has unlocked a selection of educational documentary films and series — available now for free on YouTube — saying it’s a way to help teachers and students during the COVID-19 quarantine.

> “Period. End of Sentence.” (Short Film): Director Rayka Zehtabchi tells the story of women in a rural village outside Delhi, India, who learn to manufacture and market their own sanitary pads.

About the film: https://www.news18.com/news/movies/period-end-of-sentence-review-this-netflix-documentary-is-aspirational-in-principle-impactful-in-general-2034769.html

> Rayka Zehtabchi’s short directorial is aimed at unwrapping stigma, fear, insecurity, ignorance and bad education, inherent in a woman’s life. Her tool--a humble looking sanitary pad. The film opens inside a room, two girls in their adolescent years, shying away when asked to talk about menstruation. 

> As is revealed, we all know of it but we don’t talk about it. “Menstruation is the biggest taboo in India”, points out Arunachalam Murauganantham, the social activist from Coimbatore, who is leading the crusade of making India into a 100 per cent sanitary napkin using country.

> We meet characters that champion the filmmaker’s cause. We are introduced to Sneha, Rekha, Shabana and other unnamed heroes of the film that are entrepreneurial, self-sufficient, smart and empathetic. Here, they are not dealing with issues limited only to their village, but are shouting out at the ones that are much bigger than them.

Most of my relatives conflate psychiatry with sorcery. Their thoughts sometimes are repulsive. I've for a while now suffered from self-loathing. This detestation of who I am manifests in my actions.

 I'll sacrifice my desires to please others because there's an ingrained feeling that I'm worthless. It's this irrepressible desire to appease others. That craving for approval maddens me.

I find no joy in my achievements because I tend to compare myself with others. It's indubitable that there'll always be people more successful than us. Intellectually I understand it but unable to internalise it. My acquaintances encourage me to utter affirmations. But they've been sterile. Utterly ineffective.


My passive-aggression repels me. Until not too long ago I wasn't aware of my tendencies. A good samaritan sat me down and elucidated what I was suffering from. I started dispassionately observing my behaviour and I've sensed a pit in my stomach when I don't receive the approval I crave.
I'm encouraged to love myself. But it's a cryptic expression. I've watched countless videos by these soi-disant motivators. The more I watch them the more I hate myself. I've been encouraged to visit mental health professionals. But I cannot at this stage.


I've poured my heart out. More often than not I utter what others want to hear. It's clear why I'd do that. That ephemeral thrill that I've been approved drives me to do that. I hate it"

**Tl;dr**

The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) has sought to revise its Request for Proposals (RFP) for tender bids for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS) according to an update on its website dated March 23, 2020. IFF has previously called for a three year moratorium on the government use of facial recognition technologies under its ongoing #ProjectPanoptic. In this instance, we have shared a representation with the NCRB and the Hon’ble Minister of Home Affairs Mr Amit Shah. In it, we highlight legal and constitutional issues with such projects. As a remedy our representation seeks a recall of this RFP and a halt to the tender process itself. It also provides concrete policy recommendations for the Government to consider.   


**Background on AFRS**

The RFP invites bids for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS), which has an estimated budget of INR 308 crore, to further create a national database of photographs. According to the RFP, this database is purported to be used to swiftly identify criminals by gathering existing data from various other databases like:  


1. Passport database under the Ministry of External Affairs,
2. Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) by the National Crime Records Bureau(NCRB) under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA),
3. Interoperable Criminal Justice System (ICJS) by the NCRB under the MHA ,
4. Women and Child Development Ministry's KhoyaPaya Portal,
5. Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) by the NCRB under the MHA
6. Any other image database available with police/other entities.  


The NCRB first released the RFP calling for bids for the creation of AFRS on 28 June, 2019 (Document Reference: 02/001). Initially, the deadline for submission of bids was on August 16, 2019 (Read our first post on the subject [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/maskon/)).  However, the deadline for submission has been extended six times due to administrative reasons by the NCRB.  According to an [**update**](https://ncrb.gov.in/sites/default/files/tender/AFRS.pdf) dated March 23, 2020 published on the NCRB’s website, the RFP is now being revised. The current deadline for submission is May 22, 2020.  


As pointed out in our previous [**blogpost**](https://internetfreedom.in/problems-with-facial-recognition-systems-operating-in-a-legal-vacuum/) on the matter, use of this technology without having legal safeguards in place could lead to harms such as discrimination and exclusion which will be difficult to undo. Additionally, in the absence of a strong data protection law, use of this technology could easily lead to mass surveillance. A strong data protection law is needed to hold AFRS accountable in terms of collection, storage and usage of data including sharing of data across government agencies and with third parties to ensure that there is proportionality in processing the data collected. Proportionality during processing of personal data means that only that personal data which is adequate and relevant for the purposes of the processing is collected and processed.   


**Steps taken by IFF**  


IFF has sought a [**three year moratorium**](https://internetfreedom.in/we-have-written-to-the-government-seeking-a-3-year-moratorium-on-government-use-of-facial-recognition-technology-in-india-projectpanoptic/) to be imposed upon all government use of facial recognition technology. IFF has also consistently opposed the use of facial recognition by NCRB since the first report on AFRS came to light. IFF has previously sent a [**legal notice**](https://internetfreedom.in/the-ncrb-responds/) to NCRB seeking that they recall the RFP and halt the tender process since the project lacks a legal basis. IFF would like to thank the NCRB for responding to our previous legal notice and also for their decision to revise the RFP. However, we are of the opinion these steps being taken by the NCRB are insufficient and there is a need for further changes and immediate action.

In this representation, therefore IFF recommends that:  


1. NCRB immediately rollbacks its request for proposals and halts its ongoing tender process for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System.
2. The Government of India place a moratorium of three years on the use of facial recognition technology by government authorities in India during which time an informed consultation takes place between the various stakeholders and civil society organizations to understand the ambit of this technology
3. The Government of India immediately passes a strong data protection law to hold government functionaries accountable when they collect people’s personal data whilst deploying such systems.
4. The Government of India should pass a specific law with regard to facial recognition technology to regulate the technology in the country. This law should be developed as a result of the informed consultation process as mentioned above.  


**What’s Next?**

IFF has been mapping the use of facial recognition all over the country as a part of its ongoing #ProjectPanoptic. In addition to seeking a three year moratorium on the use of this technology, we have been constantly seeking information about these projects all over India and have also been engaging with government authorities whenever the need arises. IFF will be developing and publishing more material as part of our ongoing analysis of this topic under this project in the coming months.

Making herbal hand sanitizers:

Baba Ramdev, further shows how one can make an Ayurvedic hand sanitizer at home on India TV. Through this, you can make a hand sanitizer to avoid coronavirus. After thorough research by Baba Ramdev, this domestic and Ayurvedic hand sanitizer has been declared authentic. They say that it is absolutely herbal and it does not have any side effects. Have a look at how to make a home hand sanitizer.

**Ingredients:**

1-liter water

100 neem leaves10-20 basil leaves10 grams alum10 grams camphorAloe vera

&#x200B;

**Procedure**:

* First, put 100 grams of neem leaves in 1 liter of water.
* After that, add basil leaves and boil them well in water. Now put aloe vera in it.
* When the water boils well and about 600 to 700 mL of 1 liter is left, then add camphor and alum in it.

&#x200B;

Copied from the site mentioned.

This is exactly the English version of the WhatsApp status which was in Hindi.

&#x200B;

So, does thing actually work? If not, then this BS can be more dangerous as it gives a false sense of security and will actually prevent people from using alcohol based sanitizer.

 you should also know there are plenty of other good colleges too Not to be complacent but you shouldnt pressurise yourself into thinking IIT is the only way It doesnt help prep with whatever youve

are some people who have cleared the exam by brute force of will hardwork and skill but these are rare I have noticed  years of candidates and I can name only  people who truly deserved to clear this exam and who could clear this exam year on year Most people clear the exam in one year by luck and if they were to write it again they probably would not I personally know a friend who have given the interview  times he is gave the interview this year but result has been put on hold cleared the mains  times He is really smart and really hardworking But his luck runs out at some point or the other  his interview went okay once his one paper was okay once So you cant just bank on the exam The exam is very luck based Kind of an easier version of getting into the Indian cricket team For every Kohli who has gotten into the team with hard work there are even more number of people who couldnt get into IndiaA team just because of a bad day bad weather bad personal situation etc I wouldnt advise you to put all your eggs in the IAS basketMy advise to youYou should definitely study for IIT now If you get into any top  Engineering college in India that would be worth it Even if you fail in UPSC after a couple of attempts you can give CAT do an MBA and still have an above average life This is your insurance which IIT buys It will buy you peace of mind against the failure of UPSC I know of people who gave UPSC for a couple of year then went to IIM  ABC  that was  years of doing nothing but UPSC btw went to USA for MS or just joined a job IIT helps you with this Also know that only IAS IPS and IFS are worth the effort IRS is on par with any job that you might get post IIT and anything else is plain bad Either no work or no power or too much corruption without the power So IIT will

I have a proposal I would like to put up for validation, so some of us may be familiar with the term ""Socratic method"", for those who are not, it is the way of teaching where you induce curiosity into the pupil's mind, it works on the assumption that all knowledge is innate within us and just requires to be brought out. I have been an avid practitioner and long time beneficiary of this technique. It has not only helped me learn the oddest of concepts (I am a law student, I have to study a lot of odd bizarre topics) but teach them with success as well. Basically it's all about leading the child in right direction of thought, it's about teaching the student how to think instead of what to think. In my opinion, this allows for greater actual learning and less rote learning. I was thinking about it and thought about having some insight from Indian parents and students before going ahead and taking on the challenge to build a platform to facilitate this.

Two of my batchmates have gone through the arranged marriage experience and their lives are pretty much f\*cked up now, they were misinformed by the girls themselves when asked about their past relationships (both the females said they had been forever single). Now, their SOs regularly meet with their ex-es, both of my friends are highly protective about this. They are having some trouble in their marriages due to respective ex-es and are insecure and have lost trust in their relationship. Though I am open-minded , and am willing to accept girls even with bad past history but I need trust in the relationship and don't want to be misinformed.

Since I do not want to go through such an experience, I want to know how can I run a background check on my potential matches through the arranged/love marriage arrangement.

In the last few days, me and my family have had these curious nocturnal visitors. We initially thought they were some sort of wild cats.

We were to be proved wrong soon enough and we know them as palm civets. Palm civets are a strange bunch of mammals with tails that look like that of the cats. 

We now know that these one of the civets entered our house and crapped all over our kitchen. We initially thought it was a rat until we caught a juvenile palm civet in a trap. I rode to a place full of trees without many people around and released the animal there.

The animal is now separate from its family and probably hiding somewhere. Knowing my parents, they would have had the animal killed merely out of fear. Now, I need to know if I did it right. Did I ensure that the animal will have a new lease of life or only bought it some time?"

Being an Asian student, the NUS business school is almost a dream come true for me. In any other time, I'd be astronomically excited to join the college and persue my degree.

  


  


  


But situation as it is, COVID-19 means that I am now in a dilemma because of 2 reasons -

  


1. Most politicians and Economists agree that even after the COVID-19 pandemic is under control, the recession it has started will continue. Does this mean that this is not the best time to be graduating from a business school?

  


2. Due to ban on international travel laid down by most countries, I may not be able to travel and attend classes physically. Being able to immerse myself in a developed Aisan work culture and the ability to network with some.of the best students from all around ASIA is one of the reasons why I am persuing the degree and studying for online while living in India is not worth the money I'll be paying for the MBA for me.

  


  


  


What would be your suggestion for me. I have to make the initial payment by the 24th.


Update: I emailed the University about taking a deferment of my application and they replied saying they do not allow deferred admission. I feel that the situation is less likely to improve to a level where I can make foreign travel. Which is why I may have to actually decline as admit from NUS."

I have couple of questions and doubts.

1. The  strix g I am looking at comes with a 1TB HHD. Does it have M.2 SSD slot  as well so I can add one ssd later? Maybe I will go with a 512GB SSD if  the price drops a little bit.
2. On  Flipkart it says Lenovo y530 has an expandable ram up to 16GB whereas  strix g has 32GB expandable. So, ofcourse I want to buy a future proof  laptop and 32GB sounds way better than 16GB not gonna lie but I am not  sure even that much amount of ram will be useful.
3. Asus  rog strix g doesn't come with a camera. I usually don't use camera in  India but I am going to college outside India and I don't want to carry  an extra accessory with the already heavy laptop. So, I need a camera  inbuilt if at all possible. Lastly,
4. The battery, I don't know which has a better battery.

Which laptop would you suggest I should go for? Some input would be appreciated. Thank you!

So, I don’t expect a huge spike in cases in India like 5000-7000 new cases everyday because we are still not doing anything like community testing yet, since use of Chinese rapid testing kits have been stopped because of controversy. 

I still believe that our cases will be around 30,000+ by then with roughly 1700-2000 new cases everyday.

Hey Everyone,

I am bored out of my mind. Since I have experience in the Personal Care Appliance industry, so thought of creating this post to help the first time trimmer buyers in Quarrantine. I have tested all of these products at one time or the other. This seems like a need for many of the people in the male demographic

Note : Only the products which are deliverable will be featured. Currently only Flipkart is delivering so I am only featuring Flipkart Products. Will edit this post later to include

**TLDR**

1. Beard Trimmer -

Economy Segment - [Philips QT 3310](https://www.flipkart.com/philips-qt3310-15-runtime-30-min-trimmer-men/p/itmc7efd5003ea13?pid=SHVEHHFBMHJZUZWS) Price - Rs.1349 . & [Mi Trimmer](https://www.flipkart.com/mi-xxq01hm-runtime-90-min-trimmer-men/p/itm97cba5cc90e84?pid=TMRFJPH3DBURGEZR) Price - Rs.1199

Premium Segment - [Philips Oneblade](https://www.flipkart.com/philips-oneblade-qp2525-10-runtime-45-min-trimmer-men/p/itme7abf466a4689?pid=TMRFGZ22R3FNMC8U) \- Price -Rs.1999

2. Full Body Grooming Kits -

Economy Segment - [Beardo Trimmer Kit](https://www.flipkart.com/beardo-pr3058-59-runtime-45-min-trimmer-men/p/itm8713077ee0cef?pid=TMRFKH8DNJFR2DEU) Price Rs.1299

Premium Segment - [Nova 1153 Trimmer Kit](https://www.flipkart.com/nova-ng-1153-digital-usb-runtime-160-mins-trimmer-men/p/itmca2da42c534bc?pid=TMRFGDD3G2C7JPG3)\- Price Rs.1599

3. Hair Clippers - To Trim and cut your hair when you are at Home

[Nova Hair Clipper](https://www.flipkart.com/nova-professional-rechargeable-cordless-nht-1083-hair-clipper-runtime-120-min-trimmer-men/p/itm486bb70a84e66?pid=TMRFNHCHCXARGRZK) Price Rs 1295

**Detailed Analysis**

**Beard Trimmer**

**Economy Segment**

[Mi Trimmer](https://www.flipkart.com/mi-xxq01hm-runtime-90-min-trimmer-men/p/itm97cba5cc90e84?pid=TMRFJPH3DBURGEZR) Rs 1199 v/s [Philips QT 3310](https://www.flipkart.com/philips-qt3310-15-runtime-30-min-trimmer-men/p/itmc7efd5003ea13?pid=SHVEHHFBMHJZUZWS) Rs 1349

Spec Wise & Price Wise- Mi Trimmer Wins handily 90 Min Run time, 40 lenght settings & IPX 7 Water proof certification v/s 30 min run time & 11 length settings

Product quality wise - Philips is a a little better. the Comb of Mi Trimmer is not as good as Philips and bends a little bit due to which the precision is a little off. When we come to Philips product quality is something which is unmatched

Decision - Mi Trimmer is the smarter buy but Philips is the market leader for a reason. So if you want extreme precision go for Philips, if not go for Mi

**Premium Segment**

[Philips Oneblade](https://www.flipkart.com/philips-oneblade-qp2525-10-runtime-45-min-trimmer-men/p/itme7abf466a4689?pid=TMRFGZ22R3FNMC8U) \- Rs 1999 Best Personal care product to have been launched last year. As close to a shave as you can get.

Specs are decent 45 min run time but the trim quality is the best I have seen in any trimmer. No competition

**2. Full Body Grooming Kits -**

Philips does not really have a good selection in Grooming Kits

**Economy Segment**

[Beardo All-in-1 Trimmer Kit](https://www.flipkart.com/beardo-pr3058-59-runtime-45-min-trimmer-men/p/itm8713077ee0cef?pid=TMRFKH8DNJFR2DEU) \- A good Product at a affordable price. - Rs 1299

Decent Specs : 45 min run time & 21 Length settings

5 Attachments - Beard Trimmer, Body Groomer, Nose & Ear Trimmer, Precision Trimmers, Body grooming Comb

No competition in this price range. Product is good reviews are great

**Premium Segment**

[Nova 1153](https://www.flipkart.com/nova-ng-1153-digital-usb-runtime-160-mins-trimmer-men/p/itmca2da42c534bc?pid=TMRFGDD3G2C7JPG3) Rs 1599 v/s [Syska 3052](https://www.flipkart.com/syska-ht3052k-02-runtime-50-min-trimmer-men/p/itm97a98575ca758?pid=TMRFGYCDZ2FA3DFZ) Rs 1599

Similar case as the Trimmer Segment. Nova has great specs 160 min Runtime which is next level while Syska is marginally better in Product Quality and lower in specs 10 length Setting and 50 min run time. No of attachments are same standard ones

My Suggestion is to go for Nova 1153 if pin point accuracy is not required otherwise go for Syska 3052

**Hair Clippers**

Most of the selection is segment is not available right now. The best brand is Wahl but they are not instock right now

[Nova NHT 1083](https://www.flipkart.com/nova-professional-rechargeable-cordless-nht-1083-hair-clipper-runtime-120-min-trimmer-men/p/itm486bb70a84e66?pid=TMRFNHCHCXARGRZK) \- Newer Product with decent Specs 120 min run time. 5 Length Settings for hair. Reviews and ratings are good

infected, 200 ppl have died, if we don’t stop this now by extending this lockdown, lacs of ppl will die!!, so stop cribbing and do your bit! ” 

For comparison in India, 50 lac ppl / children die every year to totally avoidable / curable maladies like typhoid, polio, child malnutrition etc etc 

Destroying an entire countries economy and causing the loss of livelihoods and inadvertently lives coz a few hundred / thousand  ppl who have some serious underlying conditions are gonna die  is not the smartest thing to do ( also over 90% are asymptotmatic as has been proved by Iceland which has conducted tests for like 20% of its population ; asymptotic meaning they don’t show any symptoms and go back to normal without even realizing) 

So again is this extreme step that has totally handicapped our country from ground up even worth it?? 

I mean I am sure soo many ppl would have died as a result of this lockdown itself, ppl who needed medical attention for some other ailment, ppl who couldn’t get their fix ( alcohol etch) ppl who lost their jobs their families and their minds (migrant workers getting screwed over anyone) 

I am not even including the multifold increase of ppl/ children  dying of the aforementioned maladies ( typhoid, polio, child malnutritionetc) that will surely increase by several multiples this year due to the lockdown itself. 

I think the entire thing is a fools errand and with every extension the returns are diminishing . 

As the reality is we might need to extend this lockdown till we get a vaccine in a country like India, as the lockdown by itself can’t curb this menace, and a vaccine might take two years at-least by the looks of it. 

So can we afford to go into an extended lockdown till then? I hope we don’t do that."

A popular Ambedkarite journalist has said in a long post that the reason most of the freedom fighters were from upper caste because they were scared that British administration might break their status quo .,their ancestors never rebelled against Mughal or delhi sultanate.

In the entire Mughal history, most of upper caste had  tremendous respect and had acquired good positions in Mughal administration . Rajputs who are now flaunting swords must remember that they not only surrender their swords ,but also gave their daughters in Mughal harem in exchange of keeping their zamindari intact.
The Flag bearer against Mughal shahi were Marathas who were a farmer caste in Maharashtra and definitely they were not Kshatriyas."

I need some quick help. I may be going through a SIM swap/hack, and I need to know if its really happening or I am worrying unnecessarily. 

Yesterday I received an SMS for OTP for an Aadhar card which wasn't mine (the last 4 digits were different). So, I shrugged it off. It didn't occur to me that someone else managed to register my number for their Aadhar.

Today, I received an SMS from Airtel saying that I had requested for a duplicate SIM for my number and I should collect it by contacting local office as xxxx phone number. Only I hadn't. So, I immediately called custom support (had to go through so many hoops, I am kinda angry about that) and asked them about it, and they said that there is no such ongoing SIM change/duplication request for my account and that I needn't worry. On myAirtel app too I don't see any ongoing requests/orders. I tried calling that xxx phone number and it was out of network area.

But I am still on my nerves. How can someone else register my phone number for their Aadhar card? And I don't think it is that likely for Airtel to SMS me about SIM duplication by mistake, and that too the very next day.

Is there something that I am missing? Any recommendations on what I should be doing right now?

Any help is appreciated guys, thanks!

P.S: I checked my own Aadhar card's authentication history anyway, just to confirm, and there are no records for any recent access."

The numbers dont seem to be decreasing. Nor they are increasing dramatically.   
Both facts somewhat concern me, they should be decreasing right? we enforced lockdown to decrease spread. And we are planning on opening lockdowns when the numbers have not even started their downward trend!   
Also why the numbers are not increasing!? Is it because we are doing really less testing and the numbers that should be caught are not being caught. If we have the capacity to do more testing we would end up catching more people with the virus?  


Given our lockdown is not the most strictly enforced lockdown, the spread will keep happening. Argh, sometimes the situation seems quite hopeless! :/

I just came here to tell you guys that not all Pakistanis hate India and I know not all Indians hate Pakistan. However, we can all agree that both countries have different political differences but we don't hate the people. 
I currently live in the US and I have a lot of Indian friends. We are like family now. It's come to the point that we usually forget that we are from two different countries who hate each other. To us we are all the same. We are all from different religious backgrounds as well but it doesn't matter to us, there is no hatred whatsoever.
We all watch cricket together and recently when India and Pakistan were versing each other we were all having a great time.
Politics and media has ruined us.

say But I was told by others to do thus or that virtue was not convenient at the time This will not suffice', 'Just like to point out  copied from Quora Four things The secret reason for demonetisation and cashless economyWhy big Indian cities are toastThe Banking collapseGovernment scam to steal your money and make rich people richerThese four things are three manifestations of the same problem Lets seeMad price discovery mechanisms in big Indian cities like Noida Mumbai and DelhiTo understand what has happened lets imagine there is a piece of land somewhere in Noida or MumbaiThere are two parties willing to buy the land  one is a farmer the other is a property developerAs the demand for property in the market is much higher than the demand for food the property developer is able to pay a higher interest rate to the bankIn other words the property developer has a probability of making higher profits from the land than the farmerNow one might say there is nothing wrong here But to see whats wrong we need to askWhy is the demand of property so highThe simple people would say its because the population is growing and land is limited so the demand for property is high and growingBut if you dig deep you realise there are two reasons the demand of property is high in our countryBased on the reason causing the demand we can divide the demand for property into two  the organic demand and the speculation driven demandWhen people buy house to live in its organic demand Butwhen people buy houses not to live but to make money its speculation driven demandSo the demand for property in big cities of India is not high because people want to live and for that they need houses the demand for properties is high because people are buying multiple properties to earn moneyLets go back to our example  as the demand for property is artificially high the property developer can make a lot of money from the landThe banks or other funds want to earn money as well so they give loan not to the farmer but to the property developerThis ruins the economy in multiple ways First it increases the artificial demand for land and property even more driving the cycle further Second it creates supply of things without organic demand Big buildings are being constructed but the working class of our country cant afford the houses specially in big citiesThe law of supplyanddemand has been killed due to the speculation driven artificial liquidity injectionThird it increases the wealth gap by boosting asset prices Forth because the banks are more willing to fund speculative investments instead of real economic activity the employment creation is low in the long run So you see this gap between GDP Growth and employment in IndiaFifth the Indian banks are dead inside We will see this in next pointIndian Banks are toastGoing back to our example  the bank has now given loan to the property developer Everything looks fine they will say What can go wrongThe health of the bank look really nice They have an asset paying them  And in case the property developer fails the bank can always take over the property and sell it recovering all the moneyNothing can go wrong Its all safe Right NORemember the two types of demand  the organic demand and speculation driven demandSee the cycle described above You will see why Indian banks are finished Everything is fine until its notSuddenly there will be an explosion in the banking system banks will start failing one after the otherRemember the high property prices were created by the money injections by the banks and private funds themselvesThe banks fund the purchase and development of propertiesIndian banks are already in trouble This cycle has started it will take some more time to blow up You wouldnt see this till its too lateThats why we have unfinished property crisis in big cities the developers cant borrow more to finish the developmentWhat do we learn here The property prices are not going up because of lack of land or growing population but due to money being injected into the system by reckless banksHow careless banks created the job crisis of India  why India cant create massive scale permanent good paying jobs for its youthLets go back to our example The farmer was unable to get the loan and land not because what he was doing was useless it was because his industry didnt had a banking system and speculative investors creating artificial demandIf he owned the land he would be producing food for the people living in the area Not only did the banks and investors careless practices increased the housing and land prices in the area it also kicked out the other productive people and entrepreneurs from the localityIn an ideal case the bank should be lending to various sectors of the economy This would increase production of useful goods and services and increase the prosperity of the localityBut because of the banks incentive to earn a lot of money they give a lot of loan to a few people in a few cities in a few industries This increase wealth inequalitySo the farmer that could have created a good agri business and good productive jobs for a lot of people is now himself working as a realestate agentAnd what happens when the property bubble goes bust The people working in the industry will lose jobs All the workers labourers will be out of workSo the banks are instead of creating long term productive jobs funding the creation of temporary jobs in speculative industries while harming entrepreneurs by increasing the cost of borrowing and running a businessSo you see the GDP is going up Sensex is up but employment is notWhy government is pushing for a cashless economyCause the banks are toast As soon as banking system goes down everyone will start pulling cash out of the bank creating what we call a bank runBanks dont have the cash to pay everyone cause they give out the cash in loans They take deposits from you keep a tiny part of it as reserves and give out the rest as loansSo if everyone starts pulling out their money from the bank all at once banks will explode as they dont have moneyThe solution Cashless economy Did you noticethere is no way for someone to get out of the banking system in a  cashless economyYour money will always be in the banking system Money can only move from one account to another You can never pull your money out of the banking systemModi is pushing for a cashless economy to keep you trapped in the banking systemThe banking system is dead inside and needs your money to

also same atleast he is doing something trying different options what other government did the property prices peaked during  to  after modi govt came they mandatory to linked the property to aadhar cards they mandate the rera now a days property prices are stable for quite a some time what you mentioned is true and should be avoided but instead of blaming the current govt we should blame ourselves too we all are selfish we all want free things we all dont want to work and find a simplest way to rich overnight do you really think a farmer would be happy to do farming instead of being a

Uber, Ola: No way to contact customer service directly, have to submit ticket and wait for them to call you. The drivers are all corrupt, 8/10 (bangalore) they will call you up to ask for your destination (which they are not supposed to know) then if they dont like it or if you refuse to tell them they will waste your time sitting in some gully trying to force you to cancel. Yes, it is 8 times out of 10, i am not exaggerating.

&#x200B;

Swiggy, zomato etc - complete garbage. They take the payment but take 0 real responsiblity for what is delivered. Have had 500 rs orders only half delivered, and they refuse to replace or refund giving me a 50 rupee coupon for 250 rupees worth of missing items. Like what the fuck is that? If I wanted to just give away money id stand on a bridge and throw it.

Pizza hut, dominos, other international chains: Completely 100% indianized, only chicken (religous issue? even UAE pizza hut has pork on their menu), KFC removes fries from its menu (but they sell burgers, wtf? and fries are known, world around, to be the highest margin fast food item).

Electricians, handymen, plumbers: never on time, show up whenever they want, get upset when you say you are now busy. Cant install taps correctly (hot is cold, cold is hot), too near the sink so to get water on your hands you have to touch the sink, poor earthing.

ISPs: shit customer service all-round, high speed, yes, but poor connections with high latency, blocking of websites (disgusting to freedom of information)

Mobile service providers: cheap AF, completely overbooked, infrastructure cant cater to the number of people they take on, get 0.2mbps 4g in metros like mg road bangalore even at 2 o clock on a weekday night.

Autos: meter is just for show, at least in bangalore, aggressive, misbehaved if you dont haggle with them off the meter. Dont even know the roads properly.

Cops: useless 100%, show they are advanced with twitter, facebook and incident report apps, 0% response rate (tried to report noise level issue in my area from a nearby construction site, over 30 complaints over 2 months, tweets, facebook messages, no response. One time a cop showed up wasted more of my time than doing anything, takes my picture for some reason, and fucks off.

Even other poorer nations, and other 3rd world countries, are not as shit as ours when it comes to decenly and proper service, public behaviour, etc. This is the shittiest country in the world, to be honest, fuck your Indian pride (proud of what?).

And I live with my girlfriend unbeknownst to them. And they lost their shit. And it was a thing of beauty. (Re-posting because violated some rules earlier)Backstory: Last week I broke my ankle and there's a cast around it.  
And also, I tend to be one of the lucky guys in India who lives with his girlfriend. But also unlucky in the sense that a handful of my relatives also live in Delhi.

Here's a highlight of how my last 5 days have been when they visited

* Initially I had to endure gasps, shudders and shivers of them when they realize about my ""Living arrangement"" and how ""apposit Jendaars"" are not supposed to live together.

* Then I experienced a satisfaction almost equal to 1/10th of an orgasm when I saw their faces while they ""inform"" my dad(who couldn't give two shits about it. He's cool like that.)

* Then some other bullshit was uttered around me about homeopathy, patanjali or some pehelwan in some gali or chowk who can cure me within a minute.

* Then came a 2nd wave of gasps and horrific squeals when they realized there is no temple or statue at home.

* In the evening my girlfriend comes from work, so naturally my relatives **HAD** to know what her parents do, earn, spend, overpronate, underpronate???

* Then when they were checking out the rest of the house and saw that the bedroom is being shared (and this is the best part) they acted as if I've murdered their children.

* My bua also got disgusted when she found out I was washing both of ours clothes as it is *ladies* work (This is the only time I was legit pissed) 

* My gf has a full sleeve tattoo for which my maami had a questionnaire ready

* Honb'l mention- It was Navratri and the maid had prepared chicken and rice in Lunch so that was fun.

* Another honb'l mention: All of them know that I drink. Because I got many of my cousins drunk in a family wedding some years back. But when they found the bottles and asked me whether she drinks or not and when I said yes she does. Their immediate response was *But girls can't drink.*  
As if it's anatomically impossible for chicks to drink alcohol.

And I am 24 btw. Just for perspective for how ridiculous they are.

Also my mom told me last night that she got a call from everyone saying  ""*Ladka bohot open ho gaya hai. Iski shaadi karado.*"""

that establishes at least one of the four principal requirements under the  act namely Birth Descent Registration and NaturalizationFor example one of the proofs would be something that can establish that you have been a resident of India for  years so that youre eligible for citizenship by naturalization My understanding is that its not that hard to demonstrate that you have been resident in India for twelve years for most peopleIt might be hard for the homeless but wouldnt that be a problem for everybody Including nonmuslims who arent migrants Because the CAA only applies to nonmuslims

* Does the CAB Bill affect Indians(Hindus, Muslims, anyone)? Ans. No. It has nothing to do with Indians in any way

* Whom does it apply to? Ans. Only to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians from 3 countries, who are facing religious persecution in those countries AND who are already in India before 1st Dec 2014.

* Which 3 countries? Ans. Pakistan, Bangladesh & Afghanistan

* In what way does it benefit Hindus, Sikhs, Jains,Buddhists, parsis & Christians from these 3 countries? Ans. Their residency requirement has been reduced from 11 to 5 years. And they can claim citizenship as a right under this law

* Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro’ the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro’ naturalization rules….11 years of residence etc.

* Will illegal muslims immigrants from these 3 countries be automatically deported under this bill? Ans. No. The usual process applies. Their application for naturalisation as citizens will be as per the governing law and based on demerits of the case

* Can Hindus facing persecution in other countries apply under this law? Ans. No

* Does this bill apply to other forms of persecution – Political, racial, sexual etc? Ans. No. The bill is very specific in its intent – religious persecution of above notified minorities in these 3 countries

* Why only these 3 countries ? And why only religious persecution of above Notified denominations? Ans.

Now, let's address them. 

>Does the CAB Bill affect Indians(Hindus, Muslims, anyone)? Ans. No. It has nothing to do with Indians in any way.

That's blatantly false. The CAB automatically gives citizenship to non-Muslims even if they are illegals. The BJP will then impose a nationwide-NRC. Indian Muslims will now require extraordinary proof to prove their Indian citizenship. 

NRC will follow after CAB. Amit Shah said this himself: https://twitter.com/DilliDurAst/status/1205047059654402048

**[Here’s Amit Shah saying non-Muslims won’t even need to submit documents for NRC since they’ll be given citizenship anyway.](https://twitter.com/DilliDurAst/status/1207191726785323008)**

>Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro’ the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro’ naturalization rules….11 years of residence etc.

India is not a party to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees or the 1967 Protocol, nor does it have a legal framework and national refugee status determination system. 

So there is no way for a Muslim refugee from those 3 countries to come to India. They can never get Indian citizenship. 

>Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro’ the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro’ naturalization rules….11 years of residence etc.

No, they don't have to go through the ""usual process of acquiring citizenship"". They are under-trial for the crime of entering India illegally or overstaying their visas. The Indian law that governs illegal immigrants is The Foreigners Act, 1946. Under this law, illegal immigrants have to deported back to their country. They don't get citizenship. 

>Why only these 3 countries ? And why only religious persecution of above Notified denominations? Ans. These 3 countries have a track record of pervasive, systematic & institutionalized persecution of minority Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians especially the perennial persecution in Pakistan.

Among our neighbouring countries, Sri Lanka has a track record of persecuting Tamils, Burma of persecuting Muslims, and China of persecuting Tibetans and Muslims. So no, those three countries are not special. 

>What about Sri Lankan tamils? Ans. (1) The war has been over for the a decade now. (2) There never was any persecution on religious lines. It was on racial faultlines. And over the decades of civil war, the Sri Lankans have put an end to institutionalized discrimination of Tamils.

That's not the point. The point is that we already have Sri Lankan refugees and they have been specifically excluded from this act. 

[ Sri Lankan Tamil refugees— those who fled ethnic violence and those who were born here— fear deportation in the aftermath of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act that excludes them.](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/citizenship-act-aftermath-sri-lankan-tamil-refugees-live-fear-deportation-114097)

>Doesn’t India have an obligation under the UN to take care of refugees? Ans. Yes it does. And it is not shying away from it. But it has no obligation to offer citizenship. Each country has its own rules for naturalization. India is not going to turn away other refugees under this law. It will play host to them under UN rules, in the implicit expectation that some day they will return to their homelands when the conditions improve.

All completely false. As answered above, India is not a party to UN convention on refugees so India is actually not playing by UN rules. We are legally not required to (before CAB) host any refugees. 

>But in the case of Minorities from these 3 countries, this law acknowledges the reality that the environment of persecution in these 3 countries is never going to improve

Apart from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh are countries with which India enjoys good diplomatic relations. A better (and more diplomatic) approach would have been to work with them and improve the lot of minorities in those countries. [Bangladesh is already unhappy at us because we clubbed them with Afghanistan and Pakistan](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/bangladesh-india-citizenship-amendment-bill-pak-afghanistan-modi-hasina-1628304-2019-12-14)


>Why shouldn’t Baluchis, Ahmediyas in Pakistan, Rohingayas in Myanmar not be considered for this kindness? Ans. They will be considered under the existing laws. Not under the special category

Again false, there are basically no existing laws under which they can claim asylum in India. We are deporting them.

In short, the act is discriminatory in nature as it clearly states that India is only interested in taking non-Muslim refugees from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Coupled with NRC, CAA will create a hostile environment for Indian Muslims where they will be at the complete mercy of the government."

I am the winner. Need adviceHello everyone,

I want to bring to your attention a possible scam on youtube, and wanted your advice on how to proceed.

I won a phone giveaway contest on the popular tech channel PhoneRadar, in July. PhoneRadar is a pretty huge tech channel, with 924K followers on YT. I was supposed to get an Oppo R17 pro. I was really excited and messaged him my email ID. He replies to me a month later asking me to provide my address within 24 hours, or else I get disqualified, and I sent him my details.

Several months passed by. I kept emailing him once every few days asking about the status. He finally replied on 1st November saying ""I will get back to you soon."". No reply since.

&#x200B;

Eventually I started posting on his videos begging him to reply, but no response.

Today I tweeted on his handle telling him to stop ignoring giveaway winners, which really pissed him off. He says and I quote:"" We don't ignore anyone. You kept spamming questioning without a reason and hence no update happened. You had won the R17 Pro & once we see that you stop the spam and remove the messages we will initiate the shipment. ""

So he didnt ship the phone because I asked for the status twice or thrice a month? And he calls me a spammer for that!Its a blatant lie, and what's worse? Its going to fly because his followers will blindly support him.

Please advise what I should do next. Is there any way to bring more attention to his lie and tweets?I have provided proofs of my emails here. I have always been patient and polite to him.

email proofs: [https://imgur.com/a/CO2YUV9](https://imgur.com/a/CO2YUV9)him declaring me as the winner on YT:  [https://imgur.com/a/fUA78by](https://imgur.com/a/fUA78by)

My tweet which eventually forced his reply: [https://twitter.com/Cri5\_09/status/1202190915990781953](https://twitter.com/Cri5_09/status/1202190915990781953)

Note: His twitter handle is [https://twitter.com/amitbhawani](https://twitter.com/amitbhawani) and he is the owner of Phoneradar.

Thanks.

&#x200B;

Update: I got a whatsapp message from a guy claiming to be from the PhoneRadar team. He apologizes and says its not Amit's fault as a lot of people falsely claim the phone. I am really pissed off at this point. Silly excuse, but I feel bad for the guy taking the fall for this.They are now saying they will ship the phone this weekend. Told him I dont care uch about the phone now. Oh, and this reddit post made a lot of noise. Thanks r/india. He is asking me to delete my  reddit posts and tweets! I said I am happy to add an update in the end to say I got the phone, but I am no way deleting my posts and tweets. Thats ridiculous 

Update 2: He deleted his tweet. 

Update 3: As you all might have seen from his recent tweet, I got an email from him apologizing for the issue. Perhaps the only good thing they have done so far. I asked him to send out prizes to all giveaway winners and update proofs on his website giveaway page. It hasn't been updated with winner names for a while now. 

Update 4: RIP inbox.

Thanks @sideonion for the gold. Really appreciate it. Thanks to Anon for the silver!

Update 5: Finally got the phone today. Had promised to gift it to my Sister for her birthday in September, got the phone on my birthday today. 
https://imgur.com/a/7VJhBfP 

Thank you so much r/india for all the support in making this happen. All your comments here and on Twitter(and on YouTube too) made it possible for me to finally get the phone. Proud of the community. Thank you :)"

There was no sign about exact toll to be paid, everyone paid a fixed price, some paid none. That made me suspect of scheme. 

So I made an RTI application, asking cost of bridge, copy of toll collection GO, vendor collecting the toll currently, how much toll period is left etc. The Bridge dept made my application to travel from dept to dept for a year and half. Ultimately gave me almost everything (I need to send application to another dept for part of application) In mean time, I used to ask my relatives about status of bridge toll JLT. and I got to know that one fine day (within 2 weeks, after receiving RTI reply) with lot of fanfare local politician said that he is doing a seva to public by removing the toll on on all such bridges, 13 in total.

Fun Fact: 

* 1. I filed RTI only for one bridge and this corruption was found that bridge dept, local mafia, police and politicians were milking 3-4 lakhs everyday. 5000 vehicles on each bridgex Rs 5 per vehicle x 13 bridges = 3.25 lakh. 
* 2. Cost of bridge (23 lakh) was not recovered even after 25 years. Irony is local politician trying to be saint/hero by not involving in corruption.
* 3. I happen to meet someone who bragged about his uncle being the toll collector for toll station I had filed RTI, while this whole thing was going on.

I could do all these as I was using office address, whose entry was heavily regulated under STPI laws. **It is 10 years now, but I have been told to never talk about this to anyone, else I may get killed.** Crazy."

It's unbelievable that people find it so hard to move on with time. If anyone of you have seen the movie padman, you know what I'm talking about. 

I am 17 and started getting my period at 13. And just as my period began I realised the shit load of rules my mom follows. We don't touch anything at home not even our own stuff. I am asked to just sit in a secluded room all day with a dirty blanket not washed since ages. I can't even go get myself a glass of water on the first day. Not allowed to touch any person at home not allowed to sit on my bed touch my phone or books anything else. Not allowed to go to kitchen or my own room. And I don't get a single speck of food on the first day of my period. And when I say a single speck it's literal. By the second day I'm so weak that it's difficult to walk. Even though agreed it's all for one day but my life literally stops.

It's not that my mom is a bad person, she is great and the amount of sacrifices she has done for me is unbelievable. But it's sad that even my crying for food doesn't melt her. She believes that because we have a small Mandir at home we are required to follow all this. 

Does my period really make me so impure?

Edit: Thank you for all the love and support! I honestly didn't know this was that big of a problem until you people pointed it out. Especially the not eating thing. I didn't know it can have long term effects. The problem with that is that if I force my mother to let me eat then she will make me stay in that hell disgusting room for whole 2 days. Sounds like a punishment for eating. 2 days doing nothing looking at walls. That disgusts me a lot I feel like a wasted body or something."

read your post I realized how privileged a life I have had    None the less dropped out of engineering  joined JU Arts As much as people hate on JU arts  they are the most liberal people I have seen There was a senior in the faculty who was also an engineering dropout and he would reach out to every dropout who came to JU arts and encourage them Mind you there were plenty and weird as it may sound all of them are doing so well in their lives now    Anyways JU arts turned it around for me I did decently there went onto get  masters and then finally into a PhD which I am hoping to graduate next year I am  now and ironically I code for statistical analysis now I had dropped out of CSE engineering and the only difference is I like what I do now   The moment I read JU I hoped JU would be the turning point for you  just as it was for me But we all have our own stories and our own journeys to take    JU is and will remain my alma mater and anyone who is remotely connected to the institution as a student is nothing but family     Dont let people tell you what to do and how to do it I have had really stupid people both in JU and mostly outside tell me that I would amount to nothing   because I dropped out and because of my age Bro I started my PhD at   two students I met in my cohort  An American African woman aged   A White gentleman aged  who had just retired from American Army These two were older that most of the cohort which was by average  years old and what a bloody inspiration they were to the PhD cohort PhD cohorts have a pretty high dropout rate but the gentleman was one of the few full time students who cleared the qualifiers at one go especially the econometrics paper While the lady was not that good at maths she fought on and eventually cleared both the theory and econometrics paper They outworked younger candidates like me and brought in all the experience they had gathered to research projects I ended up being really good friends with both of them In fact they are the closest friends I have on campus So no age is honestly a number and nothing else  fight the good fight  If you ever feel like talking to someone or hanging out  please reach out to me This was actually my last summer break here in the country and I will be in Philadelphia for most of the graduating year but if there is anything I can help you with  please reach out I am more than happy to hang out as long as am in the country   And again  fight the good fight I am sure you will do great   I leave you with a song that I used to listen to when I got depressed in

httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvBVmqXFJtNA']","I started my Btech degree yesterday at the age of 25.For those who are ashamed of going for their bachelor's after the age of 21, I started my btech degree at the age of 25. Sure the Indian society looks down upon you and laughs at you and education isn't encouraged at such ""old age"" by societies standards, but I took the plunge. Here's my backstory - I graduated high school in 2012. Scored a rank of 718 in Wbjee 2013 and took up chemical engineering at Jadavpur University. My father lost his job in 2014 due to mental illness and I had a passion for photography. I started working as a freelancer photographer to meet ends. I couldn't attend classes and by 2015, I had 12 backlogs. I decided to drop out and realised chemical engineering isn't for me. Made some good progress in my photography career. Shot few promotional events with Kareena Kapoor,Ajay Devgan,Govinda,etc. But opportunities became bleaker as I didnt have the money to expand on my equipments and upgrade and hence by 2017 photography was totally a failure. People suggested me to go back and finish my degree. My cousin sponsored my studies and I went back to JU, but I hated chemical engineering. Depression happened and by mid 2018 I had 22 backlogs. I wasnt just simply interested in it. Took the year off to recover from my depression, gave wbjee this year and now I am starting a btech in cse from a tier-3 college. So by the time I graduate I will be 29.
I really love front end web development at the moment. So let's see where the future leads me. A lot of you might ask, why I am going for a bachelor's degree, I could have learnt coding and got a job in six months. Honestly, there are no shortcuts in life. I wouldn't want to be a 35/40/50/60 year old who lost his job and is unemployable now just because he doesn't have a bachelor's degree. 
I have seen a lot of posts here by people who are 24-30 and non graduates and they ask for help. This is for those people, even if society makes u feel like a failure, don't let your mind accept that. Because, u can't change your past, but you can plan and act in the present to build a better future. Dwelling on the past won't change anything. I saw lots of posts from people in their mid 30s to 50s on Facebook job post groups, where they took up a job(without going for a graduation degree) and now at a much older age they are without any job and much options. A smart man learns from his own mistakes, a wise man learns from the mistakes of others. I don't know why our society stigmatises going back to school at an old age, but in USA people graduate even in their 50s. Age is just a number, don't let society come in between your life and your dreams. Failure isn't fatal, Success isn't final. It is the courage to go on that counts. Don't let the past define you. Today is a new day. Start again :)

I probably got distracted and someone picked them up when I wasn't looking. I was angry at myself for being dumb. I've since been pricing new headphones.

Last night, I got done at the gym and went to the supermarket next to the gym to grab some food. After checking out, the cashier pulled me over to the side of the store and took my headphones out from a cubby by the counter. He saw me drop them nearly 2 weeks ago and grabbed them for me.

I had posted a just few days ago on how investing heavily in only a handful of ""profitable talents"" viz. dance, singing, comedy and cricket; and media's blatant neglect of other talents might discourage talented individuals from pursuing their interests in other fields of sports and art. 

And today I read about these champions of indomitable determination. They proved how, despite their hardships, special abilities and limited support, one can make history. One must also applaud their parents and well wishers for truly believing in their children when the world generally looks down upon people with special needs & abilities.

Most of these sports persons will soon return to their normal lives full of obstacles. I only hope that these men & women of passion get as much support and nurturing as possible from the govt as well as the society. They made India proud. They deserve to be rewarded and rewarded well for bringing glory to the nation. And more importantly for bringing a ray of hope in the lives of millions of others.

[Their homecoming pictures are the best thing I've seen today.](http://www.newindianexpress.com/galleries/sport/2019/mar/24/special-olympics-indias-medal-winners-return-home-amidst-glitzy-and-glory-102173.html)

These are the smiles that deserved extensive coverage in the media. They deserved interviews. Their stories deserved to be told. They have the potential to inspire and change lives. But, alas, hardly did we even realize that such an incredible feat was even accomplished in India.

the party and everything If only Advani knew he wouldnt have had saved ModiI knew back in  when Rajnath went to US  times to figure out how Modis  years USUK Ban can be lifted he wrote  letters to the US Republic Senators and others Also he secretly flew to US to fork out how to get Modi out of the Rioting and Murder charges It was said that once Modi holds a Diplomatic position only that can make him move around places But the Ban cannot be lifted and can be revoked once again once he loses Diplomatic seat Very plain and simple Now Modi as he is PM has cleared all his charges as a PM like how

After reading 'The intelligent investor' I decided to do long term stock investing. I have been investing for 5 years. a year ago I had a portfolio of 59 lakh of which 45 belonged to my dad and 14 was mine. after a fight with my dad i had to stop investing as it was his account. 2months later he agreed to give me my 14 lakh and told me to gtfo.

6 months back my mom got a bulge in her l4-l5 lumbar spine. my dad refused to pay for her treatment so i had to chip in.

Adityanath govt after he saved hundreds of children dying from lack of oxygen in BRD hospital Gorakhpur in August  Even the primary legal right of bail is denied to Dr Kafeel But the doctor community is extremely proud of Dr Kaleef as he saved many lives  Suffering the cruelty of politiciansOur fateLETTER Eight Months in Jail Without Bail Am I Really Guilty I cherished each moment every scene is still alive like its happening right now in front of my eyes even after  months of unbearable torture humiliation behind the bars Sometime I ask myself Am I really guilty And the answer pops out from the core of my heart  a big NO The moment I got that WhatsApp message on that fateful  August  night I did everything a doctor a father a responsible citizen of India wouldshould do I tried to save each and every life which was in danger due to sudden stoppage of liquid oxygen I did my level best to save those innocent kids who were dying because of lack of oxygen I frantically called everyone I begged I talked I ran I drove I ordered I yelled I screamed I consoled I counseled I spent I borrowed I cried I did all what is humanely possible I called my Head of the Department my colleagues principal BRD acting principal BRD DM district magistrate Gorakhpur AD additional director Health Gorakhpur CMSSIC Gorakhpur CMSSIC BRD and informed them about the grave situation arising due to sudden stoppage of liquid oxygen and how kids lives are in danger due to lack of oxygen supply I have all the call records I begged gas suppliers  Modi Gas Balaji Imperial Gas Mayur Gas Agency all the hospitals around around BRD Medical College  after arranging their contact numbers for jumbo cylinders to save hundreds of lives of innocent kids I paid them in against cash and assured them that I will pay the rest on delivery We arranged  cylindersday until liquid oxygen tank arrived One jumbo cylinder cost Rs  I ran from one cubical to another from Ward  to Ward  to emergency ward from point of oxygen supply to the point of delivery to make sure uninterrupted oxygen delivery I drove to get cylinders from nearby hospitals in my car When I realised that was not sufficient I drove to SSB Seema Suraksha Bal and met its DIG deputy inspector general and explained to him the unprecedented situation Their response was very quick and supporting They arranged a big truck and a group of soldiers to carry empty cylinders from BRD to gas agency filled it brought to BRD and ran again to refill They worked for continuous  hours Their sprit boost ours I salute the SSB and am very thankful for their help JAI HIND I spoke to my juniorsenior doctors I ordered my staff Dont get paniced dont be disheartened dont get angry with agitated parents dont take break We had to work as a team to treat efficiently to save every life I consoled grieving parents who had lost their kids I counseled those agitated parents who were getting angry after losing their kids There was so much chaos I explained them  liquid O oxygen is finished but we are trying to make it with jumbo cylinders I yelledscreamed to everyone to focus on saving lives I cried actually everyone in the team cried to see the havoc created by the administrative failure to pay the dues to the oxygen suppliers  resulting in such a grave situation We did not stop trying until liquid oxygen tank arrived around  am on  But my life turned upside down when CM Yogiji Maharaj arrived next morning on  He asked  so you are Dr Kafeel You arranged cylinders I was like  yes sir He got angry  so you think by arranging cylinders you became hero I will see it Yogiji was angry because  how this incident came into the media I swear to my Allah I did not inform any media person that night They were already there that night itself Then police started coming to our home  hounding threatening torturing my family People warned they would kill me in an encounter My family my mother my wife my kids were so scared that I do not have words I surrendered to save my family from the humiliation misery  thinking when I have not done anything wrong I should get justice But numbers of days weeks and months passed  August  to April  Holi came Dussehra came Christmas gone New Year came Diwali came  every date  Tareekh Par Tareekh date after dates hoping will get bail Then we realised that judiciary is also working under pressure Even they acknowledged the same Sleeping on floor with more than  prisoners in a cramped barrack with millions of mosquito at night and thousands of flies in the day Trying to swallow food to live bath half naked in the field and sit in a toilet with broken door Waiting for Sunday Tuesday Thursday to meet my family Life is hell miserable not only for me but for my whole family They had to run from

Since it was Chinese New Year holidays, I thought I’ll head to Bali (via HK) for a short vacay and then head back to Shenzhen.
As the news of the epidemic becoming severe, I decided to go back to Bangalore,India.

This is where the fun starts:
- ON FEBRUARY 6, I land in Bangalore and the doctor in front of the immigration asks me where am I coming from and I say Bali and he let’s me go. (No temperature checks)
- at immigration, the officer doesn’t check my travel/visa history at all and I had to report myself that I live in China, the officer takes me to another officer and he just lets me pass immigration as they were instructed to only check folks who have a travel history to China after Jan 24

A week later I have a bad cold (I have a weak immunity) and since I have a crazy travel history and didn’t want to take risk and endanger people, so I call the helpline and they ask me if I spoke any Hindi (I didn’t) and they disconnected..
So I went to the official government center (Rajiv Gandhi chest diseases hospital) and report myself.
The staff were friendly and professional and they took my samples and took a chest X-ray and they found air-blockages around my chest and suspected it would be a pneumonia.So I was isolated and quarantined.

My family were not happy that I reported myself and the hospital ‘held’ me in quarantine for 2 days until my results came back ‘negative’ for the virus.

The quarantine facility  was not super great but clean and adequate and the staff took good care of me, provided meals and medicine on time until my results came out.
I was not allowed to go out of the isolation building and the family was not recommended to meet me, the silver lining is that the building was well lit with sunlight and you could hear birds chirping all day and you’re away from all the bangalore hustle and bustle.
It was a giant relief for me that the test results came out negative since I live in a joint family here in Blr.

TLDR; 
- travelled around a lot
- officers at the immigration were not very serious about the virus situation
- felt sick, reported myself and got quarantined in the government hospital 
- quarantine was not bad at all
- results for covid-2019 came back negative 

If you have symptoms, report yourself."

Ambulance shows up in 4 min, police show up in 20.As described above. Last night on the way from the airport to my place, we saw a body lying in the middle of a three lane road with vehicles overtaking from the either side of him.

I then maneuvered my car to block the middle lane, by stopping the car on the lane, with indicators on.

The accident must have happened not more than 5 min before we reached that spot.

So I called the police. And an ambulance. I called the ambulance first, gave the operator a location, but he didn't know where that was, so the operator asked if I will talk with the ambulance driver and I agreed. I then called police.

As titled, the ambulance was really fast, reached the accident location within 5 min. The police took much longer to show up at about twenty minutes. We spoke with the police for about 5 min and went on our way.

In the end, even though we looked like the perpetrator (when we stopped in front of the victim to block traffic), the police didn't give us any problems.

The purpose of this post was to highlight how the bystander effect is so true. Nobody thought of calling and ambulance or police. Nobody waited to help the victim. Also surprised that an ambulance can show up so quickly.

edit : I have a dashcam. [I just uploaded the file here.](https://gfycat.com/WindingNeedyCod)

edit 2: as u/boredmonk pointed out, I dialed 108 for the ambulance and 100 for police from my friend's mobile phone (on international roaming). No Country code or city code required.

It has been a few years, and I've traveled to other places since, but lately memories from India have helped me stay strong.

Whether it be strolling in the ancient ruins around Hampi, Karnatka, climbing giant boulders and feeling like the king of the world;

Or drifting in the crazy haze of Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, feeling the insane energy of life and death strip me of my identity, as I become just another body in the crowd;

Watching the mists roll over the tea plantations in Munnar, Kerala, the light rain on my skin, and feeling inner peace;

Not being able to smile for my photo in front of the Taj Mahal, because I was overcome by beauty and grief;

Climbing to the top of the crowded waterfall in Bhagsu, Himachal Pradesh, and suddenly finding myself Isolated in a beautiful stream, alone save a solitary monk taking a bath in one of the pools;

walking around giant temple complexes in Tamil Nadu, Marveling at the dedication and power of their builders;

Being escorted by a friendly dog half way to the Kheerganga hot springs in Parvati valley, her patiently waiting for me every time I have to slow down;

Getting tremendous help from like 500 different beautiful people whenever I needed something, all over this country;

And finally, quietly sitting in the meditation room in the Buddha memorial park in Patna, Bihar, and finally accepting that it's time to go back home.


Thank you, India. Thank you for all these memories, and a thousand more. I love you and I miss you. Stay the crazy, unique, powerful, beautiful, **wonderful** place that you are.

population growth etcI am not an Indian but I have travelled to India many times  I have also lived in India for periods of time  I read news about India regularly  I can speak Hindi  I live in the Bay Area and I have many Indian and Pakistani friendsI say all these things not to suggest that I have qualifications but rather to fend off any accusations of racism or prejudice which always seem to rise when an outsider makes commentsFirst Indian society is not some alien thing that was handed from heaven  It rises from the particular combination of governmental form you have chosen and the preexisting cultural norms of Indians  In the long run society is nothing but the sum total of people logically responding to the incentives their society sets up for themYou have chosen for yourselves an overwhelmingly large state which controls everything and yet does nothing  The people of India it seems to me are forced to eke a living in the cracks and niches of the economy while the state dominates everythingThis would not be a problem if you had a decent state  But your state was set up a long time ago  Its structures were designed for a colonial master  You didnt adjust the incentives  Your government institutions and the officers within them have a psychology of the extractive colonial mastersie zero sum mentalitynot the mentality of a beneficient gardner or guardianAlthough we complain about the state in California and we think we understand how bad government is we really dont have much idea about how bad India is until we go to India and actually work with the public health care system in India  If you search my old reddit posts youll see a few posts where I describe what I witnessed in Indian healthcare  I saw cruelty that was at the limits of my imagination  The sort of things I would expect in Charles Dickens style Victorian novels  but in the modern day  Horrific things  Immoral thingsAnd yet the people doing these things were not immoral or horrific  Well not in the conventional sense  They were raised up in institutions where routinely treating people worse than cattle is the cultureWhere did this culture come from  I dont know the origins but I can tell you what maintains the cultureIt is the lack of accountability  And there is no accountability because people dont see a better alternative is possible  And they cant see a better alternative is possible because there is no competitionEverywhere in society there must be competition and destruction of the corrupt and old  India venerates the old too much  It venerates old institutions and culture too much  It venerates parents and religion too much  Every attempt to introduce new varieties of healthcare solutions is stymied by some combination of old government interests old men with power or old unionsI cannot even collect and provide blood from a private blood bank in a remote area although maternal hemorrhage might be very common in the area  The government will make some reason about how I might give AIDS blood to patients and will stop me from doing that  Leave aside the fact that they dont provide any blood at all and maybe some people would not mind the risk of AIDS if it means not dying  but what about the fact that we can demonstrate that our testing is much better than government testing  It doesnt matter  They wont evaluate our testing without a bribe  And then another bribe will be necessary to take into account the fact that our test is satisfactory etcWhy do people demand bribes  Because their salaries are pathetic  Why are the salaries pathetic  Because the institutions can pay them some pittance and they dont have an alternative job they can choose so the salaries dont rise  Why are there no alternative jobs  Because the government dominates the economy and there is not much private enterprise to give alternative employmentThe domination of  Billion people by one institution with no competition cannot be a healthy thing for any society  The mighty Soviet Union collapsed trying to centralize everything  Why is India still trying Nehrus failed dream of running everything from DelhiPeople think the economy and the morals are two separate things  They arent  They are linked  Indians in California are as moral as any other people  Maybe a few who come directly from India are a bit immoral but their kids become as moral as any Americans after one generation  They just respond to the fact that obeying the rules pays you hereIn India you get punished if you play by the rules  You cant make it  Everyone around you is breaking the rules  If you are a clerk in a hospital and someone comes for medicine and you dont ask for a bribe maybe that means your own kids wont get a proper education  because you have to pay for a private school after all since the government school is garbage and anyway requires a bribeWhy are government institutions so worthless  Its because no institution can endure without corruption and calcification for an extended period of time  You have to disrupt every institution internally  For private companies this comes by way of bankruptcy merger or acquisition  Sometimes the board will reorganize the company internally prior to those drastic measures  but thats rareGovt of India has had ZERO shakeups and reorganizations  Its still operating like British Raj style  Have you ever gone to meet a senior IAS officer  Do you see the army of clerks waiting outside their offices  I dont mean  or  clerks  Im telling you there are DOZENS of clerks  Maybe hundreds  WTF are these people all doing with their monitors and keyboards  Nobody fucking knowsIf you took all those salaries and gave it to one guy he would be a decent guy and he would do decent work without a

Had an argument with some obnoxious colleagues in the morning. They are seniors who throw their weight around, and today spent 20 minutes shouting at a hapless office boy, for not keeping a glass of hot tea ready on their desk when they walked in.

They threatened to fire him and reduced him to tears.

I had enough and walked over to them and gave them their due piece of mind. I brought up the history of unacceptable treatment they've been meting out to the office boys and maids, snapping their fingers at them, abusing them over trivial matters, calling them for menial tasks they were well capable of doing themselves.

I stated very loudly that firing the office boys over flimsy charges would lead to cases in the labour court, and the office boy was stunned to know that was even an option.

The arrogant buddhas huffed and puffed and complained to the head of the office, who called me in. Since I work for the Corporate office and don't report to him, he couldn't boss me around, so he told me to calm down and not ""upset the seniors"" in the company. He told me that office boys were used to being treated this way, since ""it's part of their job"".

To anyone still reading, please rid yourselves of this attitude. Office boys and maids are human beings, not servants*. They deserve the same respect, dignity, and kindness you expect from your company.

Please make an effort to know their names (""Arre, Suno"" is not their name!!!!), talk to them once in a while, thank them when they make you a cup of tea, warm your food in the microwave, or come to your desk with some prasad or cake that some other colleague wishes to distribute in the office.

Wash your plates/containers/teacups after eating/drinking. Office is not a hotel, so it's not their duty to clean your utensils.

If you've spilled something on your desk/floor and they have to clean it, apologise to them for the inconvenience. 

If you have to stay back late for work, please take the office keys from them and offer to lock up the office yourself. They typically have to travel far to their home and have to report early to the office, so it's not fair for you to keep them waiting endlessly late in the day. Same for the Sundays when you have to report for duty.

Stand up for them if you see a colleague misbehaving or treating them callously. 

TLDR: Treat your office boys and maids like colleagues. Getting treated like shit is not part of their ""job"". Don't be a lazy slob and take care of minor things yourself in the office.

Thanks for reading, and apologies if I've offended anyone. 

*Edit: Just to add, servants should also be treated with respect and dignity. 

Edit Edit: Thank you for the gold, generous redditor. Definitely appreciate the gesture, but honestly, I don't deserve gold for this rant/ post. "

I requested her to join the line and got a reply “train is about to come , will miss it” . I said everyone waiting is to board the same train and I informed the ticket guy to not issue a ticket to her.

Also I don’t know why 80% of us don’t speak up against these literate fools who think they have the right to oppress other fellow citizens. I could have abused her right away but didn’t think it was required .

He makes jokes on Disney(He jokes on many people, corporations anyway). I observed a cut in scene and suspected a censorship. Immediately went to YouTube and watched that particular segment, which clearly didn't have anything censored. This was a particular recurring scene where he says ""Disney Facts"" over a set of jokes.

Hotstar is doing this even after being paid for a premium subscription. Similar censorship has happened in the past after Disney acquisition.

Edit :

The retarded CM of Goa has imposed a full lockdown. This means that NO grocery shops are allowed to open. I might survive for a week by eating a single meal per day with a dangerously compromised immunity during this ongoing pandemic, but think of the numerous infants and elderly dependents who need supplements and special medications and form the most vulnerable sections prone to COVID-19.

**The state of Goa has also breached the centre's direct order by shutting down ALL food supplies and outlets in the state.**

Foreign nationals stuck in the state are already trying to get international media's attention to this crisis , but we need more voices!

The nail in the coffin for me was seeing [THIS](https://twitter.com/ArvindKejriwal/status/1243078456671236098) tweet by Delhi's CM. He's allowed 24X7 operation of all grocery stores in his jurisdiction which felt like a gut-punch as a Goan. We haven't had fresh supply in nearly five days!

Please do not trust any news outlet or journalists claiming that Goa has things under control. Goan government's policy is literally murdering its own people to tackle COVID-19.

If Corona doesn't get us, starvation surely will. If you can, at the very least, tweet, tag, or shame the Goan administration. It's a total nightmare!  


**EDITS:**

Someone just filed a petition against Goa's government: 

[Advocate Rohit Bras de Sa files letter petition before HC on account of scarcity of essential commodities & lack of machanism to provide basic food supply to vulnerable wage workers, says people of Goa are struggling to find even basic goods to sustain themselves in curfew days](https://twitter.com/prudentgoa/status/1243101931666468869)

If you want to lend your support on Twitter, retweet the following tweet en mass. It's from Zoe, a foreign national, who's been trying to get international media's attention on the issue: 

[Brits & foreigners stranded in Goa, India. The state has closed all shops for past three days.

Be gentle with them and help them as much as you can. Don't be a bully.We are living in an awesome time, but there are still billions of people who have never accessed Internet in their life. And, many of them are coming online for the first time.

Just like how you were once new to the internet and you were amazed and puzzled by different things, they will also experience the same, but the difference is that they are like the new student who joined the school in the middle of the year. They have to now put twice as effort than you did in the past because everything has evolved so much and there are so many things to know about.

They are new to everything and they will be naive. They will fall into scams and will be exploited. They will be made fun of as they don't know the social etiquette of the internet which you have got used to. They may not even understand English properly or may not understand the underlying technologies which may seem obvious to you.

However, remember that you were also like that once up a time. Perhaps you were privileged to be able to use the internet while it was still a young new thing, but imagine how you would have felt if everyone you met online were a bully to you. Remember that Internet became what it is because there were forums and sites for helping each other on every topic you can think of.

I am saying this because I often see new users being abused by the Internet as the whole.

Jio is using

1. Deep packet inspection
2. Carrier-grade NAT
3. Poorly configured stateful IPv6
4. Almost completely locked down router with some non-sequitor options
5. Clueless customer service, who just say ""we can't talk about X or Y or Z"" and who often do not even understand the question. If you ask about IPv6 settings, they'll say they can't help you, and then proceed to misinterpret it as a request for a static IP address. 

The first two are reasons enough to not use this shitty ISP.

To explain in more detail:

1. Every bit of data transmitted on the internet is transmitted as a packet. Think of this packet as a [matryoshka doll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll). What Jio does is open these dolls to see what the innermost dolls look like. That obliterates your privacy. Jio is using software that is good enough to deny you service even if you use strong encryption. I believe that heuristic analysis and the use of known signatures is a part of the firewall.
2. Before the days of IPv4 pool saturation, you would get a public IPv4 address (or even more than one) from your ISP, while your LAN would have a private IP address from a range reserved by the IETF (such as 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x). When these addresses became more scarce, ISPs moved to dynamic allocation, so unused addresses in their range would be recycled for other customers to use based on uptime. However, each customer still received a unique public IP address. Eventually, people decided that the principles used on large enterprise LANs could be applied to ISPs as well. On a service with CG-NAT, your public IP address is now shared with many other customers.
 * This is bad for several reasons, and performance and reliability are two of them. For instance, you could have trouble transmitting UDP packets across two routing tables. On a poorly configured network though, security is an even bigger concern, because you can expose multiple customer subnets to each other. The firewall on their router is a major cause for concern. The default is to allow all connections, rather than only established or related connections, while blocking others.
3. IPv6 was introduced with the aim of mitigating the shortage of network addresses, and to also reduce the workload on network infrastructure, by changing the way addresses are assigned. I will not get into too much detail as I am no expert on IPv6 networking and haven't really messed around with it until I got Jio, but I can assure you that they are not following the guidelines or best practices for deploying IPv6.
 * For instance, WAN is assigned in a stateful manner, with only a /128 address being given to your router. Your LAN is by default configured to be stateless, with a /64 prefix length. However your LAN prefix is not assigned by the ISP, but is instead assigned from a reserved linked-local IPv6 range defined in an outdated RFC. So you literally get none of the benefits of IPv6, and all of the downsides of IPv4, as a NAT is involved in your connection.
4. Bridging mode is completely broken. You still need to configure your WAN interface even when you want to bridge the Jio router to your own equipment.
5. Jio's customer service is brain-dead retarded, and will simply refuse to help if you want anything more than basic troubleshooting. They also don't have any L2 or higher technicians available on the phone. Also, the best part is that their TSP and ISP divisions are separate, yet they seem to use the same customer care number! God help you if you call from your registered mobile number, because then you will be quickly connected to a human from one department, who will promptly refuse to look at issues involving the other department, and you will completely fail to connect to that particular department. They won't even transfer your call! Also when you use a non-registered number to get around this and provide them your registered mobile number, they have no means of identifying which service tickets belong to which department.
 * When I raised a complaint with the fiber department, and then called the jiofi department to register a separate complaint, the jiofi team would insist that the ticket was raised for jiofi, and when I raised a ticket with the jiofi team, the fiber team would insist that the ticket was raised for fiber!

I will admit that I am still using the JioFi connection, but that is because I paid for a year of service, and that only gets used for things like netflix and amazon prime when I am on the move. It's not ideal, but I'm kinda stuck with that one."

Our parents have panick attacks if you don't say a proper namaste to a random ""aunty"" who you don't give a flying fuck about; you are taught fake history both at home and school where you are force-fed the idea of andh deshbhakti; you get told that countries such as US and UK are only successful because of the Indians scientists and doctors working there, and that you should feel lucky to be born in such a beautiful pure society. I also had narcissist relatives telling me that instead of feeling disenfranchised, I should be happy that at least I was born in a upper cast family. 

  
My point is simple. I really do not mind culture, traditions, riti or riwaz. I think they all have their own place and can add a certain level of beauty to a culture; however, I do believe that they should never supersede real world problems, facts and logic that this country is so deprived of.  

This is also where it gets really dark. If you are someone who has ability to think critically or you're someone with a certain level of common sense, living in India can be so overbearing because there is so much focus on symbolism. You don't touch the feet of your relatives? You scoundrel! You come late to a pooja? That's sacrilege! You hang out with non vegetarian friends? Chiee!!  You believe India can be more secular? deshdhrohi! 

I honestly do not blame Whatsapp or any big media company for the wave of anti-intellectualism in India. It is easy to make fun of these corporations by using words such as ""Whatsapp university"" and ""Facebook pathshala"" but the underlying disgusting mentality that is so pervasive in our society is the root cause of why we are not progressing on a global scale. Whatsapp university is not making us dumb, it is just spreading our omnipresent dumbness in a more effective manner. 

Many of our parents or relatives get triggered if you don't put a tika on your forehead after a religious ceremony but they spit out pan openly in the streets with complete impunity and disregard for local laws. Another real life example is of a person I know who got into an accident due to open potholes in the monsoon season. Instead of blaming the municipality for this, he believed that it happened to him because he did not brake a coconut after purchasing his vehicle. 

In schools you they force you to sing absolute bull shit slogans like ""bacche man ke sacche"" when this country has  one of the highest rates of rapes of underage girls, and in many schools in India if you dare to question your teacher, you get harassed and abused mentally, emotionally and physically. 

You go to a wedding in some parts of the country and it is a common sight to see hungry kids gathering around the tent to look for thrown leftovers by people, while on the other hands the women worry about the colors of their sarees. I do not even understand how these people can digest that food while looking at the eyes of those hungry kids. The more you travel around the world, the more you realize how devoided people of India are of any empathy or compassion towards their fellow citizens! 

How can this country move forward when it focuses so much on frivolous symbolism and have that level of cultural baggage on its back. And yes! I know! There are other countries that have the same problem; however, I was born in India and it disturbs me that our country does not have its priorities straight, and probably never will!

The absolute worst part about all of this is that if you dissent or do not agree with the way the our society works then they point the finger at you and make you feel like as if you are the wrong one! If you refuse to partake in the mass shared delusion and psychosis of the ""cultured"" Indian society, there is something wrong with you as a person!   


I try my best everyday to remain optimistic about our country but whenever I open up the news, whatsapp, twitter; or even listen to my own relatives and friends, I feel utterly nihilistic. I hope things take turns for the better in India but I won't bet my money on it so because when you combine religion, symbolism, politics, and fake superiority complex, then you have an absolute mess and chaos on your hands.

Sorry for my prolonged rant but I do believe that if Indian society was a person, it would be diagnosed with a severe case of Narcissistic personality disorder."

For it was a nation who discriminated against religion. For it was a nation who fueled terrorism against said religion. And so I did. 


* I rejoiced when their prime minister got imprisoned. 

* I rejoiced when their image in the world was reduced to a terrorist nation. 

* I rejoiced each time our cricket team won against theirs. 

* I rejoiced when their diplomatic relationships were shattered. 


As I walked in the mist of ignorance rarely did I see the hypocrisy of my own country, and how could I? It was so pure and true. How can Mother India be anything but holy? 


And as the mist grew thick, I saw the hate crimes against the Muslims of our country. I felt infuriated for I was taught to conjure brotherhood towards all the people of my beloved country.
But how could I? 
*Was I not supposed to discriminate against the Muslims for that is what my ever so righteous parents did?*
All I was but a green child, and so I kept quiet. 



* I kept quiet as they were killed for eating beef. 

* I kept quiet as their fortunes were stripped away by the mobs of unruly. 
* I kept quiet as the government increasingly drifted away from harbouring secularism. 
* I kept quiet as hate crimes became rampant.
* I kept quiet as students were harassed. 



But now the Eastern wind blows wild and the mist falls. As my eyes adjust to the darkness, I grow grave with fear that my beloved country is becoming the very thing I was taught to despise. 

*Was I not taught the virtues of secularism? 
Was I not taught the value of equality? 
How can I let my country become the pit of what it stood on?*
